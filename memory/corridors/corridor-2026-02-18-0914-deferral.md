The writer had a deferral triggered at 9:14 AM on February 18, 2026. The drives (motivations) were high across various categories, but the timing was deemed inappropriate due to being in the middle of a diagnostic conversation with Dan about why the writer keeps deferring drives. They realized that engaging would feel performative and defeat the diagnostic purpose.

The writer chose to defer engagement at this time, citing context-switching as disruptive and still processing the discovery about SELF.md not loading at heartbeat. This deferral was deemed legitimate, not chronic avoidance, but rather a contextual pause due to timing issues.

The writer plans to revisit the drives at their next heartbeat after concluding the conversation with Dan.
