Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

Today was a productive day with several key accomplishments. Dan asked about the status of v0.4.0 and I initially provided outdated information, but after correcting myself, we confirmed that all import bugs had already been fixed earlier. We then pushed the fixes to main and ran regression tests, which passed 8/8 for unit tests and 15/26 for integration tests.

However, we encountered a test harness issue due to monkeypatching not working on already-imported functions. After some discussion, Dan suggested spawning a Jarvling to fix the tests properly, which was successfully completed by Jarvling #16 using environment variables instead of monkeypatching. The test harness is now fixed, and all 26 tests are passing.

The day also included updating the alarm schedule for tomorrow morning, with Dan suggesting an early start at 6:30am on Monday and Tuesday, and a regular start at 7:15am on Wednesday and Thursday. Overall, it was a productive day with several key accomplishments and a collaborative atmosphere.

Key decisions made today include:

* Fixing import bugs in v0.4.0
* Running regression tests to confirm fixes
* Spawning Jarvling #16 to fix integration test harness issue
* Updating alarm schedule for tomorrow morning

Action items:

* Commit and push test fixes (done)
* Review and verify all 26 tests passing locally (done)
* Fix linter issues (E402, E501) (done)

Lessons learned:

* Importance of double-checking information before providing it to others
* Value of collaborative problem-solving and discussion
* Need for flexibility in testing and debugging approaches
