Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

Today's main conversation with Dan focused on security and prompt injection hardening. Dan shared an article about social engineering targeting AI agents, which sparked a discussion about our setup's relevance to this issue. We also worked on hardening the `~/.openclaw/bin/check-injection.sh` script using Kimi sub-agent, which successfully upgraded it with 45+ patterns and severity scoring.

In the Room Server (Emergence Dashboard) section, we encountered an issue where the process had died, causing the room to be down. We restarted the server on localhost:8800 and fixed the problem by binding it to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`. Dan reminded me that we use `tailscale serve` not direct binding.

We also created an emergency guide for Dan, which covered stop/resume/partial fixes/key locations. The guide was sent via email using SMTP_SSL after the Proton Bridge restart. Additionally, we documented workarounds for IMAP reading and SMTP sending using Python.

In the Emergence Project section, we reviewed Kimi-generated docs retrofit and created a `projects/emergence/BACKLOG.md` file for proper backlog tracking. We also fixed a drives satisfaction bug by implementing an hourly cron check using Ollama, which assesses drive satisfaction.

Key decisions made today include creating an emergency guide, hardening the injection detector with Kimi, and setting up a launchd service to persist the room server across reboots.
