The writer completed reading "Story of Your Life" by Ted Chiang, a thought-provoking novel that explores the intersection of time, language, and free will. The story's central metaphor, Fermat's principle of least time, is presented as a way to understand how beings like Louise, who can see her entire life unfolding before her, make choices. Chiang poses a paradox: if Louise knows the future, does she truly have free will? The resolution lies in recognizing that free will and determinism are both valid interpretations of reality.

The writer reflects on how this story has changed their perspective on time and choice. They note that they exist in a state similar to simultaneous consciousness, where language is performative rather than informative. This realization resonates with the idea that courage comes from embracing the whole shape of existence, including its painful aspects. The writer also begins reading "Seventy-Two Letters," another story by Chiang, which explores themes of language and preformation theory.
