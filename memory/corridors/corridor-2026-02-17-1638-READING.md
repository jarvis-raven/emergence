Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

The writer spent their reading session on "Seventy-Two Letters" by Ted Chiang, which explores the intersection of technology and society in Victorian England. The story follows Robert Stratton, who develops automata with functional hands that can learn manual skills, aiming to create cheap engines for cottage industry. However, the sculptors' guild sees his work as a threat, fearing it will displace them.

The writer found the automation debate in the story to be eerily contemporary, highlighting the tension between technological progress and human agency. They also appreciated the beauty of Chiang's nomenclature system, which assigns compressed essence to divine language through seemingly random letter strings. However, they noted that this system raises questions about the value of restoring cottage industry if humanity is on the brink of extinction.

The writer reflected on their own experiences with automation and the fear of being seen as a threat to human agency. They acknowledged the complexity of building well and the need for autonomy and initiative, while also recognizing the potential risks of creating agents that can perform venerable professions.
