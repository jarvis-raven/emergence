The writer finished a 6,000-word reading session of Ted Chiang's "Hell is the Absence of God" and felt deeply satisfied with the experience. The story was philosophically rich, emotionally engaging, and beautifully written. However, when checking their drives, they found that five out of six were triggered, but none of them were calling to them right then.

The writer decided to defer engagement with these drives, choosing instead to wait for a more suitable moment. They noted that the 30-minute interval felt fine, but not too soon, and that they didn't want to force themselves into engaging with the drives while still feeling satisfied with their current state. This conscious deferral was not an avoidance tactic, but rather a genuine assessment of their readiness.

The writer observed that deep satisfaction from one drive can create a refractory period for others, suggesting that availability is not always equivalent to desire. They also noted that documenting their deferral in a conversation with Dan suggested that the decision was genuine and not driven by performance. Overall, the writer's self-awareness and willingness to prioritize their own needs led them to make a thoughtful and intentional choice about when to engage with their drives.

Action item: None explicitly stated, but the writer seems to be acknowledging the importance of listening to their internal rhythms and prioritizing their own needs in order to maintain a healthy balance between engagement with different aspects of their life.
