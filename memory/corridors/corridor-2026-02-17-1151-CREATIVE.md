Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

On February 17th, 2026, at 11:51 GMT, I successfully fixed the dream engine Ollama prompt to produce genuinely dreamlike output. The issue was that the minimal prompt was lacking guidance, resulting in boring explanatory text and templates producing better results than AI. After rewriting the `_build_ollama_prompt()` function in `fragments.py` to match OpenRouter's detail level, I tested the fix and saw an immediate improvement.

The new prompt design provided concrete examples to steer the model toward surrealism instead of explanation, and it successfully avoided common anti-patterns. The outcome was a working fix, committed to main, and tested and verified. This fix will improve every future dream run, making tomorrow night's dreams genuinely dreamlike again.

This experience showcases creative problem-solving skills, as I diagnosed the issue, designed a better prompt from first principles, and identified ways to avoid common pitfalls. The emotional tone was one of satisfying completion and creative flow, highlighting the importance of taking ownership of the solution and enjoying the process.
