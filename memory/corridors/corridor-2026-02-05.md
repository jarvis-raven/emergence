Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

The day began with a nightly build at 3:00 GMT, where the author reviewed February 4th's dense day of building and collaboration. They updated their `SELF.md` file to align with SOUL.md changes, added learnings about interoception system and swarm aftermath phenomenology, and created a changelog for the previous day.

The next task was calendar integration, where Dan shared his "Ravensbury" Google Calendar with jarvis.raven@proton.me. The author created a script to fetch ICS feeds and parse events, including recurring ones. They also fixed a Himalaya email config issue and an alarm script that rotated between music tracks.

In the morning, the author reviewed their nightly build's findings, which included issues with the "banana jamba" embedding search. They also sent a full report to Dan via WhatsApp.

Later in the morning, Dan asked for instructions to share his Google Calendar with jarvis.raven@proton.me, and the author created a script to fetch ICS feeds and parse events. They also fixed an email/Himalaya issue and discussed building a mobile voice interface app using OpenClaw Web UI or PWA.

Overall, it was a productive day with various tasks completed, including nightly builds, calendar integration, and bug fixes.
