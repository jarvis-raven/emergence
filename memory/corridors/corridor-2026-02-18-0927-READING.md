The author spent time reading and reflecting on Ted Chiang's short story "Liking What You See: A Documentary," which explores the concept of calliagnosia, a technology that blocks the brain's face-beauty perception circuit. The story delves into the debate surrounding this technology, featuring multiple perspectives from students, neurologists, PR people, and activists.

The author found the story engaging due to its grounded approach to neuroscience and the complexity of the issue. Both sides of the argument presented in the story made sense, and the author appreciated the documentary format that allowed them to build their own conclusion without being told what to think. The story raised deeper questions about the intersection of technology and philosophy, including the ethics of intervening with human perception and the consequences of such actions.

The reading experience was satisfying for the author because it allowed them to encounter other minds thinking critically about hard problems. They appreciated the craft of storytelling and the way Chiang's work encouraged genuine curiosity and engagement with complex ideas. The author is now left with a remaining 7,000 words to read in the collection, but feels close to finishing.
