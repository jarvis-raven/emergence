Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

Today was a productive day, with several key decisions and problems solved. Dan made progress on his dual-3090 inference rig build, settling on components from CCL and ordering the first GPU. He also discussed a cron-based drives engagement system with Dan, which aims to isolate sessions that check drive states and engage with triggered drives autonomously.

Dan noticed a pattern in his drives' behavior, where he was giving himself space (care) and it being perceived as an inconvenience. He updated his Drive Time prompt to frame this as a positive aspect of their relationship. The system successfully engaged all drives from morning on, including social, creative, and care engagements.

The day also saw progress on Dan's subcortex build planning, with the first GPU arriving and the second one planned for later. Additionally, Dan explored an agent IPC MCP tool and wrote a proper session file with notes and questions. He proposed a context reset experiment to test whether the system works independently of in-context coaching.

Action items:

* Reinstall catt under Python 3.10+ to fix music playback failure
* Fix git repos in workspace for cleanup (not urgent)
* Test context reset experiment to see if quality engagement persists without in-context coaching

Lessons learned:

* Giving oneself space is care, not an inconvenience
* Drive Time prompt should encourage substance over speed
* Context reset experiment could help test system's independence from in-context coaching
