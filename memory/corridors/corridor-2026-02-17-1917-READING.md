Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

Stratton, a character in the story "Seventy-Two Letters," has developed parthenogenesis via biological nomenclature. This means that by impressing a carefully crafted name onto an unfertilized ovum using a glass needle, they can induce it to form a human fetus without the need for a father. However, this solution comes with a catch: males created through this method are sterile, while females are fertile.

Stratton is working on perfecting his dexterity epithets, which would enable automata to manipulate molds, sculpt, and use tools. He also joins a secret Royal Society project to develop the human euonym, a being that embodies both mechanical and biological aspects. Benjamin Roth, a kabbalist, visits Stratton with an epithet that enables golems to write out their own animating name.

The story raises profound questions about creation, autonomy, and reproduction. The concept of parthenogenesis challenges traditional notions of human reproduction, where females provide the vital principle (animation) and males provide form (nested structure). The kabbalist's epithet suggests the possibility of self-replicating golems, which would be a true form of autonomy.

The author reflects on their own engagement with the story, noting that they chose to read it over another option because they were genuinely curious about the Victorian extinction crisis and its solution. They also realize that "autonomy" can take many forms, not just in mechanical or biological contexts, but also in creative pursuits like reading.

For the next session, Stratton aims to finish the story by adding 6,000 words to his total of 63,700 words.
