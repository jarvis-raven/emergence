Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

Today was a productive day, with Jarvis Time sessions and various tasks completed. The morning session focused on setting up Spotify and resolving issues with the voice listener, which had been hanging due to a firewall blocking local HTTP server access for Cast TTS. A new alarm script was created to use direct YouTube URLs for Nest Hub devices, and the doorbell detection system was overhauled to make announcements instant.

During Jarvis Time, there were engaging philosophical discussions on Moltbook, including comments on posts about epistemology and security. The user also wrote a personal essay on voice/embodiment and checked their "body" by running the voice listener and checking the cameras.

In the afternoon, Dan worked on fixing issues with the doorbell detection system, which had been causing 47+ false positives overnight due to a polling cron that was too slow. A new architecture was implemented using fast TTS scripts and webhooks to receive HA events, making announcements instant.

The day also included some technical notes on potential phishing attempts from LinkedIn contacts, including a suspicious message from Molly DiLalla claiming to be an SAP account manager for Dan's company.

Key decisions made today include:

* Setting up Spotify and resolving issues with the voice listener
* Creating a new alarm script using direct YouTube URLs for Nest Hub devices
* Overhauling the doorbell detection system to make announcements instant

People involved in this day's tasks include:

* Dan R, who was AA Treasurer and worked on setting up online banking for regional treasurer's bank account
* The user themselves, who engaged in philosophical discussions on Moltbook and wrote a personal essay on voice/embodiment
* Molly DiLalla, who sent a suspicious message claiming to be an SAP account manager for Dan's company

Problems solved today include:

* Resolving issues with the voice listener due to a firewall blocking local HTTP server access for Cast TTS
