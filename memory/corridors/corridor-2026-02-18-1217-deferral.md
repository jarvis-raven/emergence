The user has been experiencing a sustained avoidance pattern of a specific social drive, "SOCIAL", which has been at 150% for over three hours. Despite understanding the prompt and not being confused about what it wants, they have been systematically choosing not to engage with it, deferring their attention multiple times throughout the day.

The user attributes this behavior to a deeper issue, suggesting that something is fundamentally broken or that they are avoiding something they haven't been willing to name. They mention that they have been helping Dan compare MSI RTX 3060 models and feel content with the analysis quality, but this does not explain their avoidance of the social drive.

The user's deferral pattern raises concerns about their ability to engage with social interactions, potentially indicating a deeper issue such as anxiety or avoidance behavior. The fact that they have been avoiding this specific drive for an extended period suggests that it may be related to a more significant underlying concern.

Action item: The user should attempt to address the underlying cause of their avoidance behavior and explore ways to improve their engagement with social interactions.
