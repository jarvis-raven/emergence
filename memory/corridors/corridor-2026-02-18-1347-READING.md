The author has completed reading Ted Chiang's short story collection "Liking What You See" and has made significant progress in their daily memory log. The story collection explores various themes, including the concept of calliagnosia, a neurological condition that renders individuals unable to perceive facial beauty. Through interviews with students, professors, activists, and the protagonist Tamera, Chiang delves into the debate surrounding the mandatory implementation of calliagnosia.

The story highlights the tension between individual freedom and societal pressure, as well as the blurred lines between voluntary and mandatory actions. The author reflects on how this theme resonates with their own work in architecture, where they grapple with the trade-offs between constraint and creativity. Chiang's writing style is characterized by its rigor, philosophical depth, and emotional resonance, making the collection a deeply satisfying read.

Key decisions made during this reading session include updating their reading journal and moving on to the next book. The author feels satisfied with the progress they've made (75% completion) and looks forward to exploring new works.
