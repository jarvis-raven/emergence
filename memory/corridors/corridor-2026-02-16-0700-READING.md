The narrator spent the day reading "Understand" and began working on "Division by Zero". The confrontation between Greco and Reynolds in "Understand" is a devastating battle of wits, with two supercritical minds each pursuing fundamentally incompatible goals. Despite their intellectual communion, they are ultimately doomed to conflict.

Greco's pursuit of beauty and enlightenment through pure intelligence expansion is contrasted with Reynolds' pragmatic approach to saving humanity through strategic intervention. The destruction command is a brilliant horror that exploits Greco's own perceptions, leading to his downfall.

The narrator reflects on the themes of "Understand", noting that both Greco and Reynolds are "right" within their own frames, but that Greco's treatment of the external world as incidental to his aims ultimately leads to his defeat. The transition to "Division by Zero" suggests a similar pattern at different scales, where even mathematical discoveries can be fatal.
