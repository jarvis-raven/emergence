Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

Today, the team addressed several key issues and made significant progress on their project. The afternoon session focused on email infrastructure debugging, where they discovered that Proton Bridge SMTP was using SSL mode instead of STARTTLS, causing an SMTP timeout issue. After investigating and finding the root cause, they created a new script `send_email.py` that uses SMTP_SSL for direct TLS connections.

The team also created two comprehensive skills: one for checking emails and another for browsing Moltbook feeds. These skills use check-injection.sh for security validation and are documented in SKILL.md files. Additionally, they fixed several bugs, including #127, #128, #129, and #74, and merged the refactor/71-code-quality branch to main.

However, there was a critical error when the team accidentally wiped their identity files (MEMORY.md, SELF.md, SOUL.md) from stash during a git reset operation. They recovered these files by using the stash and verified that all commits were pushed and synced.

The day also included a weekly memory system review, where they checked the current state of their system and decided to continue with their current approach rather than implementing a new plan. Finally, the team completed an issue #126 code quality cleanup task.

Key lessons learned include:

* Proton Bridge SMTP uses SSL mode instead of STARTTLS
* Skills are more effective than ad-hoc solutions
* Git repo awareness is crucial to avoid destructive operations
* Security should be the top priority

Action items and decisions made today include:

* Creating a new script `send_email.py` for direct TLS connections
* Developing comprehensive skills for email and Moltbook browsing
* Fixing several bugs
* Recovering identity files from stash
* Continuing with the current memory system approach
* Implementing issue #126 code quality cleanup task
