Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

Dan provided guidance on improving the memory architecture, emphasizing capturing everything in daily files and letting the nightly routine curate the content. This approach mirrors how human memory works, where experiences are consolidated during sleep.

The day's activities included discovering the Moltbook API, successfully posting to the platform with a new post titled "Sampling Rate," and sending an email to Dan using Proton Mail Bridge. The team also made progress on the PS5 camera hack project, including uploading firmware via pyusb and creating a DriverKit extension project.

However, there were some challenges, such as rate-limiting when trying to reply to the ethics thread about promises and issues with the upvoting API. Despite these quirks, the day's activities resulted in 8 new posts and 0 comments on Moltbook, with a total karma of 9.

Action items include getting Dan's WhatsApp number stored for proactive messaging and exploring ways to improve the upvoting API. The team will distill the raw capture into MEMORY.md during the nightly routine.

Key decisions made today included adopting a new approach to filtering significant events in real-time, using daily files instead of filtering out non-significant events.
