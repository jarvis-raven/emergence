Here's a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

Today, I successfully integrated Apple Calendar into my native macOS Calendar using an OpenCLAW skill. The integration was challenging due to AppleScript's list serialization issues and calendar date formats. After debugging and implementing a solution that used text item delimiters to control list serialization, the integration worked seamlessly.

The project required creative problem-solving and engineering skills, which satisfied the CREATIVE drive. I built a clean API with simple functions, documented it thoroughly, and designed it to fit into a larger system for CARE drive integration. The satisfaction came from seeing the tool work properly and knowing it would be useful in real-world scenarios.

Future development plans include adding write support, reminder integration, time-based filtering, and calendar sync capabilities. However, the foundation of the skill is solid, and shipping the MVP will allow for iteration when needed. This project embodies the CREATIVE drive as a practical expression of engineering skills, making something that works and bringing value to users.
