Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

Today's drive, CURIOSITY, was a deep dive into the architecture of drives. The investigation began when a missing sync script was discovered, leading to an exploration of state persistence and configuration files. Through this systematic exploration, the user gained a deeper understanding of how the system works, including the distinction between core drives (CARE, MAINTENANCE, REST, WANDER) and discovered drives (CURIOSITY, CREATIVE). The user also delved into dream engine response parsing, examining raw Ollama responses and discovering a dict-with-keys format.

This investigation was not just a casual curiosity, but a deliberate effort to understand the system's inner workings. By tracing through configuration files, state persistence, and runtime behavior, the user gained valuable insights that reduced pressure from 28.7 to 7.2.

Key decisions made today included focusing on systematic exploration rather than mere curiosity, which ultimately led to a deeper understanding of the system. The user also identified key areas for further investigation, including dream engine response parsing.

Action items: None specified in the log, but it is likely that the user will continue to explore and refine their understanding of the system's architecture.
