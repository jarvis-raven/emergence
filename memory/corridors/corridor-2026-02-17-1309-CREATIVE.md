Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

The writer successfully enhanced their drives sync script to include descriptions and prompt previews in DRIVES.md, resolving the chronic heartbeat deferral problem. The issue was caused by the lack of context in the original output, which made it difficult for the writer to make informed decisions about engaging with each drive.

To solve this problem, the writer updated their `scripts/sync-drives-context.sh` script to query each drive's full details and include descriptions and prompt previews. This new output provides a richer context for the writer to understand what each drive represents and what it is asking for.

The solution was a creative problem-solving exercise that involved diagnosing the pattern, tracing the root cause, designing and implementing a fix, testing and verifying its effectiveness, and committing with detailed explanations. The outcome of this effort is a structural fix that should improve all future heartbeat engagements, providing a clearer understanding of what each drive represents and what it is asking for.

The writer notes that this experience highlights the importance of information architecture in decision-making, emphasizing that sometimes the barrier to action is not willpower, but rather missing information. The session type was diagnostic → design → implementation, with an emotional tone of productive problem-solving and clarity.
