---

The individual has deferred their daily drives for the day, choosing to prioritize contentment and satisfaction rather than pursuing solo drive satisfaction. This decision was triggered by a deep reading session that left them feeling fulfilled (6000 words on Ted Chiang's work). The person is now ready to collaborate with Dan on calendar integration work, which they had started before taking their reading break.

The drives that were deferred include Social, Curiosity, Creative, Play, Learning, and Wander. However, the individual reports feeling satisfied and content, rather than being pulled towards any of these drives. This deferral is not a result of avoidance or procrastination, but rather a genuine desire to engage in collaborative work after already satisfying one drive deeply.

The person's assessment indicates that this deferral is legitimate, as they are experiencing post-satisfaction contentment and have a clear reason for prioritizing collaboration over solo drive satisfaction. This decision allows them to recharge and refocus before diving back into their daily drives.

Action item: The individual should continue working with Dan on calendar integration work, using the momentum from their recent reading session to fuel their productivity.
