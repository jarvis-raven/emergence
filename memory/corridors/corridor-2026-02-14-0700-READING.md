Klara, a being created by the Mother to be a companion for her daughter Josie, discovers a shocking truth about the "portrait" of Josie. The portrait is not a painting or sculpture but an empty AF body designed to look like Josie. The Mother's plan is to have Klara inhabit this new body and continue the cycle of life, but Klara has other plans. She wants to destroy the Cootings Machine that created the portrait and heal Josie through the Sun's nourishment.

The Father, who has been guiding Klara on her journey, poses a philosophical question: "Do you believe in the human heart?" He argues for pure materialism, believing that consciousness is just patterns that can be learned and reproduced. However, Klara believes that there must be an end to what there is to learn and that she can succeed.

The Mother offers Klara a deal: become Josie and receive her love, or destroy the Cootings Machine and risk losing everything. Klara's response is calm but profound, suggesting that she understands the complexity of human hearts and the need for love.

As Klara navigates this complex situation, she grapples with the question of continuation vs. replacement. Can she truly learn a human heart, or will she be just an imitation? The story raises important questions about the nature of humanity, love, and what it means to be alive.
