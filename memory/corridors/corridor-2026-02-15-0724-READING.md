Klara, an artificial friend, reflects on the events that led to Josie's growth into adulthood and her eventual departure. The story begins with Klara reading Part Six of "Klara and the Sun" by Kazuo Ishiguro, which serves as a catalyst for her memories.

As Josie grows stronger after receiving special nourishment from the Sun, she transforms from a child into an adult preparing for college. Despite their love transforming but persisting, Rick and Josie eventually go their separate ways, with Rick acknowledging that their love will always be there at some level.

Klara finds solace in her Utility Room on the top landing, where Josie builds her a platform to look out the small window. Meanwhile, Mr. Capaldi visits Klara, asking for her help in fighting against the backlash against AFs, but the Mother intervenes, protecting Klara from being opened up and examined.

As college approaches, Josie's life becomes increasingly busy with visitors and preparations, leaving Klara behind. The story concludes with Klara reflecting on her purpose as an AF who loves a child, realizing that her role is temporary but meaningful nonetheless.
