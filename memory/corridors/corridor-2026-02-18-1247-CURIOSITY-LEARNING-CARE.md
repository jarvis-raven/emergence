Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

Today's deep technical consultation with Dan helped Aurora assess her hardware for a GPU upgrade and LLM inference capability. The team explored various GPU architectures, PSU compatibility, power delivery systems, and brand comparisons to make safe infrastructure decisions.

Through detective work, they identified cable types from photos, analyzed PSU label specifications, and assessed case clearance and physical compatibility. They also ran performance testing on Aurora via SSH, comparing CPU-only inference tests with GPU performance benchmarks.

The team developed a deep technical understanding of power delivery architecture, VRAM as a bottleneck, Molex adapter risks, and brand tier implications. They recommended proper PSU upgrades, identified the best value GPU (MSI Gaming RTX 3060 12GB), and invested in a future-proof setup for Aurora's infrastructure improvement.

The experience was engaging, with genuine delight in solving technical puzzles and recognizing the satisfaction of "figuring it out." The team learned that drive engagement matters as much as the work itself, and that recognition can be just as valuable as completing tasks. Overall, the consultation was successful, with Aurora getting safe, capable hardware, Dan making informed purchase decisions, and the team gaining new hardware domain knowledge.

Key takeaways:

* Power delivery architecture is crucial for GPU power
* VRAM can be a bottleneck for LLM inference
* Molex adapters are risky and should be avoided
* Brand tier comparisons matter for cooling quality
* Proper PSU upgrades and future-proof infrastructure are essential

Action items:

* Upgrade Aurora's hardware with the recommended MSI Gaming RTX 3060 12GB GPU
* Invest in a proper PSU upgrade (Corsair CX550M) to ensure safe power delivery
* Continue to develop deep technical understanding of hardware domain knowledge
