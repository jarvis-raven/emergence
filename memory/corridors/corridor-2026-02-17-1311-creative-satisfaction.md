Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

Today's drive was marked by a creative session with moderate depth, where the team made progress on a choice-driven project aimed at increasing satisfaction. The pressure before and after the drive decreased significantly, from 12.3 to 6.2, indicating a successful outcome.

The root cause of a heartbeat deferral issue was diagnosed and addressed by updating the drives sync script to include descriptions and prompts in the DRIVES.md file. This fix resolved the problem and restored normal functionality.

A key lesson learned is the importance of regular updates to critical scripts, such as the drives sync script, to prevent issues like heartbeat deferrals from arising.
