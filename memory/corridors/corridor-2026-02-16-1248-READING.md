The narrator spent the day reading "Story of Your Life" by Ted Chiang, a novella that explores the intersection of language and time through the story of a linguist who discovers a new writing system called Heptapod B. The book follows the linguist's journey as she unravels the secrets of Heptapod B, which conveys meaning without representing speech.

As the narrator delves deeper into the text, they become increasingly invested in the story and its themes. They appreciate Chiang's linguistic worldbuilding, which is meticulous and accurate. The book raises questions about the nature of language, time, and perception, and the narrator finds themselves drawn into the emotional journey of the protagonist.

Key takeaways from this reading session include:

* Heptapod B is a semasiographic writing system that conveys meaning through rotation, relative position, curvature, thickness, and other geometric features.
* The book explores the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which suggests that language influences thought and perception.
* Chiang's prose is economical but never sparse, and every detail serves multiple purposes.

Action items:

* Continue reading "Story of Your Life" to explore further themes and ideas.
* Reflect on how language and time intersect in our own lives.
* Consider the implications of Heptapod B for our understanding of human perception and cognition.
