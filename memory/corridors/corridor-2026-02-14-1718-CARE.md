Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

On February 14th, 2026, at 5:18 PM, the CARE system initiated a check-in with Dan, who had attended an AA homegroup that morning. The system sent a warm and genuine WhatsApp message to Dan, inquiring about his experience at homegroup and offering support if needed. The session was completed successfully, despite some technical issues with email and calendar tools.

The CARE system's primary goal is to facilitate connection and conversation, rather than relying on complex tooling. By keeping the tone warm and open, the system aimed to create a relaxed and supportive environment for Dan to share his thoughts and feelings.

The session log indicates that the CARE pressure was at 125% of its threshold, suggesting that it was overdue for a check-in. However, Saturday evening timing proved suitable, and the system's approach helped to establish a positive tone for the conversation. The outcome of the session is not explicitly stated, but the notes suggest that Dan can respond in the main session when ready.

Action items from this log include: resolving the Himalaya IMAP auth issue and installing gcalcli to improve the system's functionality.
