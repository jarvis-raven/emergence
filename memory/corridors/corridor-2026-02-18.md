Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

Today was a productive day, filled with technical sessions and personal updates. The day began with a successful dream engine run, processing five memory files and generating eight dreams with an average score of 96.2.

In the morning, Dan had a three-hour deep technical session about upgrading Aurora's hardware for Large Language Model (LLM) inference. They tested various GPUs and CPUs, concluding that a new RTX 3060 12GB GPU would enable faster inference speeds. The team also learned that 12V rail capacity is more important than total PSU wattage for GPU power delivery.

In the evening, Dan pointed out a recurring events bug in the calendar app, which was causing missed AA meetings. After troubleshooting and finding the root cause (TCC permissions), they set up a cron job to check TfL tube status and weather before leaving for an AA meeting at 4:45 PM tomorrow. The team also celebrated hitting their weekly Opus rate limit and discovered that OpenRouter Opus with fixed routing feels like a solid fallback.

Action items include:

* Purchasing the RTX 3060 12GB GPU
* Setting up TCC permissions to grant Calendar access to Node.js
* Creating daily memory logs throughout the day

Lessons learned include logging daily memory throughout the day, creating session files, and being mindful of repeated queries in Calendar.app.
