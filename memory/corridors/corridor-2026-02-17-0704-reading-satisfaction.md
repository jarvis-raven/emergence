Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

Today was a productive day in the reading session, where the focus was on resolving a technical issue with the dream engine's Ollama parsing bug. The team successfully fixed the bug by improving the parser to extract fragments from nested structures and updating config paths to point to the actual workspace memory location. After multiple test runs and debugging, the fix was committed and tested successfully, resulting in 8 dreams now flowing from the model instead of templates.

The pressure level decreased significantly, from 45.0 to 11.2, indicating a successful resolution of the issue. The team learned about Ollama response variations and JSON mode limitations, which will be useful for future improvements.

Action item: None mentioned in the log, but it can be assumed that further testing and monitoring are necessary to ensure the stability of the dream engine.

Lessons learned: The importance of robust parsing and config path management was highlighted, as well as the need to consider Ollama response variations and JSON mode limitations.
