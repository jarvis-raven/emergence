Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

Today's maintenance session was a success, with the system health check passing after identifying two key issues. The first issue was an OpenClaw version mismatch between the running software (2026.2.9) and the installed version (2026.2.15). This discrepancy was addressed by updating the running software to match the installed version. Additionally, a configuration gap in emergence cost tracking was discovered and documented.

The pressure level decreased significantly from 40.3 before the maintenance session to 10.1 after its completion, indicating a substantial reduction in stress or anxiety. The maintenance session's outcome is attributed to thorough diagnostic findings and recommendations, which were fully documented for future reference.

Key decisions made during this session included updating the OpenClaw software to ensure compatibility and addressing the emergence cost tracking configuration gap. These actions demonstrate proactive problem-solving and attention to system health.

Action items from today's maintenance session include reviewing and implementing the full diagnostic findings and recommendations in the documentation, as well as ensuring that all future updates are properly tested and validated.
