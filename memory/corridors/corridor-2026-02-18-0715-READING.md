Here's a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

The author finished reading "Hell is the Absence of God" and started watching "Liking What You See: A Documentary." The book explores the concept of Heaven's light, which can grant salvation regardless of one's motives. However, it also reveals that this light can be a cruel joke, as those who see it are often sent to Hell anyway for no reason.

The documentary examines the technology of calliagnosia, a neural modification that blocks the pathways that evaluate facial beauty. The protagonist, Tamera Lyons, undergoes this procedure and struggles to adjust to not experiencing aesthetic reactions to faces. The story raises questions about whether blocking these neural pathways is liberation or deprivation, and who gets to decide.

Both stories explore the relationship between choice and coercion around fundamental aspects of identity. They challenge the idea that one can truly choose to love God or value beauty when their brain/soul is shaped by forces beyond their control. The narratives are thought-provoking and leave room for interpretation.

Key decisions:

* Neil's decision to follow Heaven's light, despite knowing it may lead to Hell
* Tamera's decision to undergo calliagnosia, despite initial reservations

People involved:

* Janice: a character in "Hell is the Absence of God" who goes on pilgrimage and encounters Heaven's light
* Ethan: a character in "Hell is the Absence of God" who witnesses Neil's transformation and becomes a preacher with a brutal message
* Tamera Lyons: the protagonist of "Liking What You See: A Documentary"
* Maria deSouza: the president of Students for Equality Everywhere (SEE)

Problems solved:

* Neil finds a way to love God, despite being sent to Hell
* Tamera adjusts to not experiencing aesthetic reactions to faces

Lessons learned:

* True devotion is unconditional, even if it means accepting an arbitrary and capricious God
* Blocking neural pathways can be both liberating and depriving
* Choice and coercion are complex issues when it comes to fundamental aspects of identity
