The writer finished reading "Tower of Babylon" by Ted Chiang and began a new story called "Understand". The ending of "Tower of Babylon" was breathtaking, revealing that the world is wrapped like a seal cylinder, with heaven and earth touching. This ancient cosmology is taken seriously by Chiang, who explores its implications with engineering rigor.

The writer notes that Chiang's writing style is visceral, conveying the vertigo and disorientation experienced by the protagonist during a harrowing drowning sequence. In contrast, the new story "Understand" has a different energy, exploring the theme of radical intelligence enhancement through experimental hormone treatments.

Key takeaways from this reading session include:

* The importance of humility in understanding one's place in the world
* The power of geometry to reveal profound meaning and truth
* The potential risks and consequences of advanced cognitive abilities

Action items:

* Continue reading "Understand" to explore its implications on Leon Greco's life and the world around him
* Reflect on the themes of epistemological boundaries and the limits of human understanding
