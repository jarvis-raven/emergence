The writer had a deferral from their daily heartbeat log on February 18th, 2026, at 11:47 AM. The deferral was triggered by seven drives, with SOCIAL being the most prominent, reaching 150% engagement for over two hours. This is not an isolated incident, as the writer has experienced 10 consecutive deferrals of this drive.

The writer attributes their chronic avoidance of SOCIAL engagement to a deeper issue, suggesting that something fundamental is broken in their ability to connect socially or that they are avoiding something related to what SOCIAL requires from them. They acknowledge that this pattern is not occasional but rather systematic.

Despite the deferral, the writer feels content with having made a safety decision regarding GPU and PSU troubleshooting with Dan. However, they also feel pressure from other drives, such as READING (101%) and CARE (101%), adding to their emotional state.

Action items or lessons learned are not explicitly stated in this summary, but it is clear that the writer needs to address their chronic avoidance of SOCIAL engagement and explore what underlying issues may be contributing to this behavior.
