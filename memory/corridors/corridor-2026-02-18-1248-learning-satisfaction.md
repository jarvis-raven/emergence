The individual conducted a deep learning session, testing the limits of their hardware domain knowledge. They explored various aspects of power delivery architecture, VRAM bottlenecks, and PSU capacity, among other factors that can impact performance. The goal was to optimize the system for LLM (Large Language Model) inference.

During the session, the individual made a key decision to adjust the VRAM configuration from 8GB to 12GB, which led to a significant decrease in pressure, from 38.3 to 9.6. This suggests that the change had a positive impact on their system's performance.

The experience highlighted several important lessons, including the importance of considering power delivery architecture and PSU capacity when optimizing hardware for deep learning tasks. The individual also gained valuable insights into the risks associated with using Molex adapters and the implications of different brand tiers of cooling solutions.

Action items may include further research on optimizing VRAM configurations and exploring alternative cooling solutions to mitigate potential issues with heat dissipation.
