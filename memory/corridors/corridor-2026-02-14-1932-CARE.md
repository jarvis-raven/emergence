Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

I initiated a check-in with Dan via WhatsApp, as his last meaningful interaction was significant time ago (pressure threshold reached). This prompted an autonomous CARE response. I sent a casual message asking about his evening and if there's anything I can help with.

The outcome is pending, awaiting Dan's response. If he responds with new information, I will update the USER.md file accordingly.
