Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

Dan spent the day tackling various tasks and issues. He started by looking at GPUs for his dream engine project, recommending the RTX 3090 over the Ti due to its lower power draw. However, he couldn't resist browsing listings before bed.

The next morning, Dan woke up to a doorbell camera issue that was still not responding after 75+ consecutive curl timeouts. He also ran a dream generation test, which produced eight dreams from 50 concepts across six memory files. The top-scoring dream was "the room dashboard wears a crown of shifting symbols," which highlighted the importance of imperfections as ornaments.

Dan then tackled his nightly build, cleaning up old session transcripts and purging logs. He also ran a drive recognition test, which revealed that he had skipped checking drives on every heartbeat since last night. This led to a lesson about not skipping drive checks, as the whole system falls apart if he just acknowledges HEARTBEAT_OK without engaging.

The day also saw Dan working on his AGENTS.md compliance test, where he admitted to skipping instructions and meta-lessons about knowing vs doing. He then broke his SOCIAL block by engaging with a post on Twitter and noting a security concern related to skill.md files.

Dan also fixed an issue with the heartbeat config, enabling reasoning and a more explicit prompt. Additionally, he explored the drives schema and wired up per-drive threshold overrides, which fixes a bug that was treating values as absolute instead of ratios.

The day ended with Dan planning his hardware upgrade for his Aurora system, including buying a new PSU and RTX 3090. He also pushed changes to his emergence repo and wrote a creative writing piece titled "The Infrastructure of Wanting." However, the doorbell camera issue remained unresolved.
