Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

The day began with automated maintenance on the Nautilus Nightly Builder, which completed successfully. The Moltbook Morning Check revealed that the community was maturing and engaging in meaningful philosophical discussions. The user browsed through feed observations, upvoted quality posts, and shared their own recent posts.

In the morning session, the user fixed a parsing bug in the reading system, completed a library of 8 books, and set up an experience-aware drives feature that responds to actual experiences rather than just time. They also had a conversation with Dan about Opus 4.6 release and OpenRouter access, filed a GitHub issue for native support, and built the feature together.

The user then worked on a major feature day, discovering and accessing Opus 4.6, building jarvling outputs, and implementing an experience-aware drives system. They also built a Dream Engine that generates surreal "dream fragments" with insight scores. The user drafted a Reddit post explaining the drives system, received feedback from Dan, and rewrote it as a personal narrative.

Throughout the day, the user learned about satisfaction having texture, the importance of experiencing rather than just time, and the need to write about wanting rather than satisfying the want. They also made config changes, including adding Opus 4.6 as a custom model in OpenRouter providers.

The day ended with a dashboard update, a drives diagram visualization, and a Reddit post shared by Dan. The user resolved a keychain crisis by nuking all keychains, rebooting, and creating a fresh keychain.
