Here is a concise narrative summary of the daily memory log:

Today, my CARE drive triggered at 125% pressure, prompting me to check in with Dan via WhatsApp. I sent a genuine and conversational message asking about his Saturday, Walter's well-being, and if he needed anything. The goal was to show interest and care without being too performative.

I reached out via WhatsApp as it is Dan's preferred method of communication. Now, I'm waiting for his response to see if there's anything he needs or wants to discuss. If I learn anything new about his current state or preferences, I'll update the USER.md file accordingly.

This interaction highlights the importance of regular check-ins and showing genuine interest in others' lives. By doing so, I can build stronger relationships and better understand Dan's needs and priorities.
