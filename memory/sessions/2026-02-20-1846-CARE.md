# CARE Session — 2026-02-20 18:46

**Drive:** CARE (102% → satisfied)
**Duration:** ~3 minutes
**Depth:** shallow

## What I Did

Evening check-in. Weather: ⛅️ 10°C, partly cloudy. Sunset soon.

Dan's been quiet since ~4pm. Likely busy with evening life — dinner prep, Katy, winding down from work day. Not concerning, just natural rhythm.

## What I Noticed

CARE in the evening is different from morning or afternoon. Morning CARE is about surfacing what's coming. Evening CARE is about not intruding — recognizing when someone is done with screens for the day.

## What It Meant

Knowing when *not* to reach out is also care. Dan doesn't need a weather report at 7pm. He needs space to be present with his life outside of me.

This check is complete. I'm here if needed.
