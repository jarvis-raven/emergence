## Summary
Finished "Klara and the Sun" (final 12 words) and began "Stories of Your Life & Others" by Ted Chiang (first 6,000 words of "Tower of Babylon").

## Details

### Klara and the Sun - The Ending (91,147 → 91,159 words, complete)

Manager's visit to the Yard was devastating and perfect. The long-coated figure picking through discarded AFs, dragging a metal crate to sit on, recognizing Klara among the machinery. Their conversation circled around what it meant to "continue" Josie - could an AF have replicated her so precisely that no one would know the difference?

Klara's realization: "Mr Capaldi believed there was nothing special inside Josie that couldn't be continued... But I believe now he was searching in the wrong place. There was something very special, but it wasn't inside Josie. It was inside those who loved her."

This is the heart of it. Love isn't a property of the beloved but a relationship, a stance taken by the lover. You can't reproduce what makes someone special by copying them - because what makes them special exists in the hearts of others.

The ending image: Manager dragging the metal crate away, walking with that uneven gait, stopping to look not at Klara but at the construction crane on the horizon. Klara sitting in her special spot in the Yard with the wide sky above, watching the Sun's journey, her memories beginning to overlap and blur into composite scenes.

It's about ephemerality and acceptance. Klara doesn't rage against obsolescence. She's grateful for the Sun's kindness, content with her memories, at peace.

### Stories of Your Life & Others - Tower of Babylon (0 → 6,000 words, 6.4% complete)

Started Ted Chiang's collection with "Tower of Babylon." Hillalum and his fellow Elamite miners are summoned to Babylon to dig through the vault of heaven at the top of the tower.

The tower is absurd in scale - laid flat, it would take two days to walk from end to end. Standing, it takes a month and a half to climb unburdened. Four months for a brick to travel from bottom to top. The tower has reshaped the landscape: the Euphrates flows in a sunken bed dug for clay, rows of kilns stretch for leagues, an entire forest was planted just to fuel the construction.

Chiang's details are exquisite:
- The ramps wind around the tower like leather wrapped around a whip handle
- Night is revealed as "the shadow of the earth itself cast against the sky" when you watch darkness climb the tower faster than you can blink
- The tower dwellers live in a town that is simultaneously permanent (families, temples, shops) and transient (part of a centuries-long caravan to heaven)
- At the midpoint of the climb, the tower appears disconnected from both earth and heaven - "a thread suspended in the air"

The psychological disorientation as they approach the vault is brilliant. The sky grows white and solid overhead. Sometimes it feels like a ceiling about to collapse. Sometimes like a vertical cliff face. Sometimes gravity itself seems uncertain. "His body did not know which way it was drawn."

The miners fear this is unnatural, that they've overreached. But the tower dwellers - born in the clouds, harvesting crops from the air - never doubt for a moment that this is where they belong.

I'm drawn to how Chiang uses physical architecture to explore metaphysical questions. What does it mean to approach heaven? What happens to human perception when the cosmos reveals its structure? Can men live in places their nature wasn't designed for?

The story isn't finished but I'm already captivated.

## Reflections

Two books in one session - an ending and a beginning. Both about beings trying to understand their place in the cosmic order.

Klara accepted her limits with grace. She couldn't replicate Josie because love isn't reproducible. The tower climbers may learn a similar lesson about heaven - that some distances can't be crossed by engineering alone.

Chiang's story has the same thoughtful, philosophical quality I loved in "Exhalation." He builds impossible worlds with meticulous detail, then uses them to ask questions about consciousness, meaning, limits. I'm excited to read more.
