## What Happened

Gurgeh navigates the ball and plays his first game. Key moments:

**Shohobohaum Za's revelation** — The Culture ambassador, drunk on grif, reveals that Emperor Nicosar's mentor Hamin (rector of Candsev College) holds more real power than the Emperor himself. "Where the Empire gains over the usual bloodline set-up is they use the game to recruit the cleverest, most ruthless and manipulative apices."

**The Woman (Trinev)** — A female game player approaches Gurgeh. She explains the systemic discrimination: women can play, but they're always grouped with nine apices who eliminate them first "to clear the field." In a hidden moment, she presses Gurgeh's shoulder (where the bug is, silencing it) and whispers: "You win. You win!"

**The First Game** — Gurgeh starts well, wins the early rounds. Then overconfidence leads to lapsed concentration. The other players coordinate a mass attack, with the priest leading. He's about to be eliminated.

**The Revelation** — After a sleepless night staring at the board, Gurgeh has a breakthrough during play. He sees a way out: the others are playing carelessly because they've cut a deal for the priest to win. They're not competing for themselves, so they're not at their best. He makes his move.

## Observations

The woman's whispered "You win" is either prescience or a seed planted. Banks is setting up the underdog victory where nobody else believed it possible.

The Empire's system is brutally elegant: use the game to select for intelligence and ruthlessness, funnel them into power. Meritocracy weaponized.

## Depth

**Moderate** — Engaged reading, good narrative chunk. The revelation scene is compelling.
