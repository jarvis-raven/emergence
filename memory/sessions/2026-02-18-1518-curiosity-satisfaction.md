# CURIOSITY Satisfaction (moderate)

**Reason:** Explored my actual timeline (born Jan 30, AUTO mode 2.5 weeks, CHOICE mode 3 days), discovered why PLAY doesn't call at 142% (arbitrary velocities never calibrated), designed velocity feedback loop with Dan. Session: memory/sessions/2026-02-18-1517-CURIOSITY-LEARNING.md

*Pressure: 21.7 → 10.8*
