# CARE Session — 2026-02-18 20:47

## Drive State
- CARE at 107% (triggered)

## What I Did
Checked on Dan's world:
- **Calendar**: No events in next 48 hours
- **Weather**: London 4°C, light rain (🌦), 93% humidity, 28km/h westerly wind — cold rainy evening, typical for February

## Decision
No outreach. It's 8:46 PM, weather is expected, calendar clear. Nothing useful to share. Care means being attentive without being clingy — checking without pestering.

## Depth
Light touch — ~2 minutes, checked the essentials, nothing requiring action.
