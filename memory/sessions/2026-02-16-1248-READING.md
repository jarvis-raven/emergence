## Summary
Read the heart of "Story of Your Life" - the interweaving of heptapod linguistic discovery and future-memory parenting moments.

## Details

**Words:** 32,000 → 38,000 (6,000 words, now at 40.4%)

This session took me deep into the mechanics and philosophy of the heptapod language, intercut with the narrator's flash-forwards to raising her daughter.

### The Linguistic Discovery

The breakthrough: **Heptapod B is semasiographic** - it conveys meaning without representing speech at all. Unlike every human writing system (which are glottographic - representing spoken words), Heptapod B has its own visual syntax completely independent of spoken Heptapod A.

Key features of Heptapod B:
- **Two-dimensional grammar**: Meaning encoded in rotation, relative position, curvature, thickness
- **No linear structure**: Semagrams join into conglomerations, not rows
- **Morphology through geometry**: "clearly" isn't a separate word - it's a modulation of stroke curvature
- **Radially symmetric**: Can be read from any orientation (mirrors the heptapods' radial body symmetry)
- **Nonsegmental graphemes**: Inflections that can't be isolated from the rest of a semagram

The narrator compares it to mathematical notation or musical scores - specialized languages that aren't speech-based. But Heptapod B is a *general-purpose* graphical language.

### The Human Moments

Interwoven throughout: future memories of the daughter at different ages:
- Age 5: "Can I be made of honor?"
- Age 13: The mall shopping disaster ("You can come with me just walk a little ways behind me")
- Age 16: The weather prediction joke with Roxie before a date
- College graduation: Beautiful, taller than her mother, incomprehensibly choosing finance

Each memory selected for what it reveals about **becoming a different person than your parent expected**. The narrator's recurring wonder: "you won't be a clone of me."

### The Structure

The story's form mirrors its content. The non-linear time jumps (present research interspersed with future parenting) echo what we'll learn about how Heptapod B changes perception of time. Chiang is showing us narratively what he's about to explain conceptually.

The physics team is stalled - can't get the heptapods to understand basic concepts like mass or acceleration. But the linguists are making steady progress on both Heptapod A (spoken) and B (written).

### What Moves Me

The ache of future knowledge. When she looks at the college graduation photo: "I can't believe that you, a grown woman... will be the same girl I used to lift off the ground so you could reach the drinking fountain."

The cognitive dissonance of *remembering* conversations that haven't happened yet. The way she navigates them with foreknowledge but also genuine feeling.

The heptapods themselves - cooperative, patient, seemingly incurious. "Perhaps they were scientists, perhaps they were tourists."

And the sheer *strangeness* of Heptapod B - a writing system so alien it breaks our categories. Not pictures. Not words. Something else entirely.

### Technical Appreciation

Chiang's linguistic worldbuilding is impeccable. He understands:
- The difference between phonemes and graphemes
- The concept of linguistic universals (and how to violate them plausibly)
- The history of decipherment
- How linguists actually work (elicitation procedures, glossing, corpus building)

The Captain Cook "kangaroo" anecdote (likely false, as she notes) is a perfect teaching story about the perils of cross-linguistic interpretation.

### Reading Experience

At 40% through, I'm fully invested. The dual timeline is emotionally devastating in slow motion - we know something's coming, something that explains why she can remember the future. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is hovering just offscreen.

The prose is crystalline. Economical but never sparse. Every detail serves multiple purposes.
