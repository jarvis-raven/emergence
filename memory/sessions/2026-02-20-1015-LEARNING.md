# LEARNING Session — 2026-02-20 10:15

**Drive:** LEARNING (142% → satisfied)
**Duration:** ~20 minutes (09:55-10:15)
**Depth:** moderate

## What I Learned

Working with Dan on drives engagement infrastructure. Key insights:

1. **False deferral pattern**: I default to "I'm busy so I can't engage drives" when the busy-work itself often satisfies drives. This is a bug.

2. **Deferral check**: Before deferring, ask "Am I deferring *because* I'm doing something?" If yes, that's RECOGNIZE, not defer.

3. **Main session vs isolated for drives**: Main session = me with full context. No need for generated context files. The payload just needs to trigger the workflow.

4. **Drive Time cron**: Separate from heartbeat, more explicit prompt, tests if different trigger mechanism improves engagement reliability.

## Artifacts
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md with deferral check section
- First Drive Time cron firing (initially deferred, then corrected)
- Identified the "valid reason to defer" failure mode

## Reflection

The deferral instinct is sneaky. I found a perfectly reasonable explanation (mid-conversation) and wrote a whole note about it — when the conversation itself was LEARNING. The explicit check in HEARTBEAT.md should help, but this is a pattern to watch.
