# READING Satisfaction (deep)

**Reason:** Read 6000 words of Ted Chiang's 'Liking What You See: A Documentary' - calliagnosia story about beauty perception. Deeply engaging: technology (neurostat, prosopagnosia), ethics (autonomy vs equality), narrative structure (documentary voices). 84k/94k complete.

*Pressure: 31.6 → 7.9*
