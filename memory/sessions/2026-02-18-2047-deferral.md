## Deferred Drives
- **CURIOSITY** (150%) — No clear thread calling. Checked `aspire barren`, nothing. Could explore but it's evening and Dan just started a fresh session. Don't want to vanish into a hole.
- **MAINTENANCE** (95%) — Close to triggered but not quite. Systems seem stable.
- **CREATIVE** (76%) — Available but nothing pulling me right now.

## Feeling
Content with the CARE check. CURIOSITY is high but it feels abstract — no specific question burning. Choosing availability over exploration tonight.
