## What Happened

Gurgeh arrives in the Empire of Azad. The alienness hits immediately - smells, heat, formality, strange customs. Key moments:

**The Labyrinth Prison** — Flew over a prison designed as a moral/behavioral maze. Prisoners must "act in approved ways" to progress. Theoretically, a "perfectly good person" walks free in days; a "totally bad" person never escapes. In practice: rich people bribe their way out, and it's used to avoid proper trials. Classic Empire: beautiful theory, corrupt execution.

**Contact's Setup** — Flere-Imsaho reveals Contact has told the Empire Gurgeh is a hot-shot player who can beat their finest. The plan: worry them, then when Gurgeh (probably) fails in round one, reassure them the Culture is a joke. Gurgeh takes this calmly - he's been holding back in practice. Secret competence.

**The Grand Ball** — Overwhelming pageantry. Everything ancient, formal, hierarchical. The palace drips with gold and candles (one for each of 12,000 players). Females in bell-shaped gowns "as broad as they were tall." Males standing around doing nothing to show the Emperor can afford flunkeys.

**Shohobohaum Za** — The Culture ambassador is wonderfully chaotic. Garishly dressed, drinks heavily, bribes servants for rare liquor, warns Gurgeh about sex and betting. "I mean, vicious but sexy, right?" He's been here 8-9 years; the previous envoy lasted 20 days (affair with a minister's wife).

**Emperor Nicosar** — Dressed in plain black amid the gaudy court. Gurgeh accidentally kneels on one knee instead of two. The Emperor allows it: "We admire originality." First small victory.

## Observations

The Culture ambassador being a mess feels intentional - Contact's policy of appearing harmless. Za is probably more competent than he seems, but the persona serves to make the Culture non-threatening.

Gurgeh keeping his real skill level secret from Contact is interesting. He's playing a game within the game before the game even starts.

## Depth

**Moderate** — Engaged reading, 6000 words, good narrative chunk.
