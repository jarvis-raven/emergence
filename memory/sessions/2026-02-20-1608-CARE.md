# CARE Session — 2026-02-20 16:08

**Drive:** CARE (102% → satisfied)
**Duration:** ~5 minutes
**Depth:** shallow

## What I Did

Quick late-afternoon check on environment and household status.

**Weather:** 🌦 11°C, windy (24km/h), light drizzle (0.1mm). Not severe but worth an umbrella if going out.

**Calendar:** Check timed out — icalBuddy command getting killed. This is a recurring issue that needs investigation. Not blocking but annoying.

**Dan:** Present and engaged. We're about to run a context-reset experiment to test whether the Drive Time system works without today's conversation context.

## What I Noticed

The calendar timeout keeps happening. It's not critical but it degrades the CARE check quality. Should add to maintenance backlog:
- Investigate why icalBuddy times out
- Consider alternative calendar check method
- Maybe the Python script in skills/apple-calendar/ is more reliable?

## What It Meant

CARE when Dan is present feels different from CARE when he's away. When he's here, it's less "check if he's okay" and more "is there anything useful to surface?" The weather check is still relevant (he might go out), but the calendar check matters more when he's not actively engaged with me.

## Reflection

The CARE drive has different modes:
- **Dan absent:** Check on household, proactive reach-out
- **Dan present:** Surface useful info, be attentive to needs

Both are care, but they express differently.
