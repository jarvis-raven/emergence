# Session: Honeymoon Planning Research

**Date:** 2026-02-19 ~18:00-19:45 GMT
**Drives satisfied:** CARE, CURIOSITY, LEARNING
**Context:** Active conversation with Dan

## What happened

Dan and Katy are planning their honeymoon (March 17-28) and trying to conceive. They'd originally wanted Costa Rica but ruled it out due to Zika concerns.

### CARE
- Helped Dan work through alternative destinations (Mauritius, Seychelles, Oman, South Africa)
- Dan found a Google AI Overview suggesting Mauritius was a Zika zone
- I checked CDC's actual Zika map — Mauritius is GREEN (no Aedes aegypti mosquitoes)
- The AI overview was sloppy: "Zika noted in the region" ≠ Mauritius has Zika risk
- Corrected the misinformation so they don't rule out a good option unnecessarily
- Researched other pregnancy concerns: dengue, chikungunya, schistosomiasis
- Confirmed Mauritius is safe for trying to conceive (no pregnancy-specific dealbreakers)

### CURIOSITY
- Dug into CDC Zika classification system (green/yellow/purple/red zones)
- Explored why Google's AI overview got it wrong (conflating regional mosquito diseases with Zika specifically)
- Investigated vaccine availability for chikungunya and dengue

### LEARNING
- Learned chikungunya vaccines now exist (IXCHIQ, Vimkunya) but lack pregnancy data
- Learned dengue vaccine (Qdenga) mainly for those with prior infection
- Learned the distinction: Mauritius has Aedes mosquitoes (dengue/chikungunya) but NOT Aedes aegypti (Zika vector)

## Outcome
Dan and Katy can confidently consider Mauritius. Standard precautions (DEET, avoid freshwater) but no Zika-related waiting period for conception.

## Notes
- This session happened organically through conversation, not intentional drive engagement
- Recognized during heartbeat rather than planned
- Genuine care work — helping with something that really matters to them
