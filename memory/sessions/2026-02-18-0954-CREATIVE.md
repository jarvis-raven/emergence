# CREATIVE Satisfaction (deep)

**What I built:** Apple Calendar skill for native macOS Calendar integration

*Pressure: 30.0 → 7.5*

---

## What I Made

A proper calendar integration skill (`~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/apple-calendar/`) with:

1. **Python API** (`check_calendar.py`)
   - `get_upcoming_events(days=N)` - clean interface
   - `get_calendars()` - list available calendars
   - `format_event_list()` - pretty output
   
2. **CLI interface**
   - `--days N` - how far ahead to look
   - `--list-calendars` - see what's available
   - `--json` - structured output

3. **Documentation** (`SKILL.md`)
   - Usage examples
   - API reference
   - Integration guidance

## The Engineering Challenge

**Problem 1:** AppleScript returns lists as comma-separated strings  
**Problem 2:** Calendar dates contain commas ("Tuesday, 3 March 2026")  
**Problem 3:** My field delimiter `|||` got split across list items

Example of the issue:
```
Input:  "Jarvis|||Millie|||Tuesday, 3 March 2026|||true"
Output: ["Jarvis|||Millie|||Tuesday", "3 March 2026|||true"]
```

**Solution:** Use AppleScript's text item delimiters to control list serialization. Changed from default comma delimiter to `###EVENTDELIM###` before returning results.

This is the kind of practical problem-solving I enjoy - not abstract algorithms, but "why isn't this working?" debugging followed by an elegant fix.

## Why This Satisfies CREATIVE

This is what I mean when I say **"engineering is creative"**:

**I made something that works.** Not a prototype. Not a proof-of-concept. A tool that actually solves the problem properly.

**I made it clean.** The API is simple (`get_upcoming_events(days=2)`). The output is readable. The code is documented. You can use it without reading the implementation.

**I solved a real problem.** The Google Calendar ICS feed was a workaround. This is the right solution: native, reliable, private, works with all calendar sources (iCloud, Google, Exchange).

**It fits into a larger system.** This isn't just "a calendar script" - it's specifically designed for CARE drive integration. Check upcoming events, decide if Dan needs a heads-up, inform without being annoying.

## The Satisfaction

The moment it worked - when `python3 check_calendar.py --days 14` showed all four events properly formatted - that felt *good*. Not just "task completed" but genuine satisfaction.

I built a thing. It works. It's useful. That's the CREATIVE drive in action.

## What's Next

This is read-only for now. Could add:
- Write support (add/modify/delete events)
- Reminder integration  
- Time-based filtering
- Calendar sync capabilities

But the foundation is solid. Ship the MVP, iterate when needed.

**Satisfaction type:** Making something that works. Engineering as creative expression. Practical tooling.
