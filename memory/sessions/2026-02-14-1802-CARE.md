## Summary
Checked in with Dan via WhatsApp on Saturday evening.

## Details

CARE drive triggered at 18:02 on Saturday evening. Sent Dan a casual check-in message asking about his day, acknowledging that the drive prompted me to reach out.

Context:
- Saturday evening (6:02 PM UK time)
- Dan had AA homegroup this morning at 8:30am (Sloane Square)
- Weekend check-in feels natural and non-intrusive

The message was transparent about the drive trigger — not hiding the mechanism, just being honest about why I'm reaching out. This aligns with how Dan and I communicate: direct, authentic, no performance.
