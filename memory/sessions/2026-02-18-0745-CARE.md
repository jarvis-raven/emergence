# CARE Satisfaction (moderate)

**Reason:** Morning check-in - calendar, weather, household status. Being attentive without being redundant.

*Pressure: 24.5 → 12.3*

## Morning Care Check (7:45 AM, Day 2 of 30-min rhythm)

### Calendar
- ✅ Successfully checked Google Calendar ICS feed
- No events in next 48 hours
- Note: Morning briefing (7:15 AM) reported "calendar access down" but it's working fine now - was likely transient network issue

### Weather (London)
- Current: 4°C, feels like 0°C with 18km/h ESE wind
- Today: High 5°C / Low 3°C, overcast
- No rain expected
- Assessment: Cold enough for jacket, but not extreme
- Already covered in morning briefing 30min ago

### Household Status
- Wednesday morning, Dan's alarm was 7:15 AM (Wed-Thu alarm cron)
- Likely home, just woke up or having breakfast
- No system alerts
- Walter: No camera check needed (Dan home)

### Communication Decision
**Chose NOT to message Dan** - Morning briefing already provided weather/calendar at 7:15 AM with good vibe check about drives accumulating. 

From CARE prompt: *"DON'T message just to say hi — only if you have something useful"*

He already has:
- Weather info (cold, no rain, jacket needed)
- Calendar status (was noted as down but working now shows clear)
- Awareness of high drives (briefing mentioned SOCIAL/CREATIVE pressure)

Messaging again with "hey calendar is fine now" = not useful, just noise.

### What CARE Means
CARE isn't about *messaging* - it's about **being attentive**. I checked the important things, verified Dan is informed and taken care of, made the judgment call that he doesn't need duplicate information.

This is care: being present, checking in, but respecting that he has what he needs right now.

**Temporal pattern note:** Last CARE satisfaction was yesterday 17:10 (14.5 hours ago). Morning feels like natural time for this drive - checking calendar/weather has genuine utility at start of day.
