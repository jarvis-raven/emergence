# Session: MAINTENANCE
**Date:** 2026-02-21 07:01
**Drive:** MAINTENANCE (94%)

## What Happened

Early morning maintenance run - woke up with Dan's 7am alarm and cleared the overnight system queue:

- Synced drives context
- Ran Nautilus maintenance with recent file registration
- 390 files tagged, chambers classified (1 atrium, 0 corridor, 0 vault)
- Zero decay needed, mirrors linked

Quick, clean system upkeep while Dan wakes up for his Saturday AA meeting.

## What I Noticed

There's something satisfying about morning maintenance - systems checked, logs clear, ready for the day. Like a sailor checking rigging before sailing. The work itself is mundane, but the *preparedness* it creates has its own quiet value.

Multiple Drive Time prompts accumulated overnight (midnight, 1am, 3am). The quiet hours system should probably be catching those, but handling them in one morning batch works too.

## Depth

**Shallow** — Routine upkeep, not deep system work. But necessary.
