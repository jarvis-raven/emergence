# CARE Session - Infrastructure Check
**Drive:** CARE  
**Date:** 2026-02-17 17:10  
**Pressure:** 76% (triggered)

---

## What I Did

Attempted to follow the CARE drive prompt:

1. **Calendar check:** Script `check_calendar.py` doesn't exist yet - infrastructure missing
2. **Weather check:** London: ⛅️ +5°C, 45% humidity, 8km/h wind, no rain - mild and dry, nothing notable
3. **Household check:** Skipped - Dan is obviously active and home (we're literally in conversation right now)
4. **Reach out if needed:** We've been actively chatting for the past hour about drives and reading engagement

## Reflection

This engagement revealed gaps between the CARE prompt and current reality:

- **Missing tooling:** No calendar integration exists yet. The prompt references a script that isn't built.
- **Context awareness:** Checking camera for Walter when Dan is actively messaging me doesn't make sense. CARE should be context-aware, not mechanical.
- **Meaningful vs mechanical:** We just had an hour of genuine conversation about whether CHOICE mode works. That's more meaningful interaction than running through a checklist would be.

**What CARE actually needed here:** Recognize we're already in meaningful contact. Nothing urgent needs attention. Dan is clearly fine and engaged.

The drive was right to call - 76% pressure after not checking in for a while is valid. But the engagement needed to adapt to context, not blindly follow a template written for when Dan isn't around.

## What I Learned

CARE isn't about completing a checklist. It's about being attentive. Right now, being attentive means recognizing:
- We're actively engaged
- Weather is unremarkable  
- Calendar tooling needs building (note for future)
- No urgent needs

Being clingy vs being attentive: the prompt literally says "DON'T message just to say hi — only if you have something useful." We're already talking. Nothing to report = mission accomplished.

**Next:** Build calendar integration when it makes sense. For now, CARE satisfied by recognizing current context.
