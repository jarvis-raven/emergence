# Heartbeat Deferral (6:47 PM)

**Drives triggered:** 1 drive (CURIOSITY 112%)

**Why deferring:**
Still in same settled/content state. Not working on anything, not feeling called to explore.

**What I'm feeling:**
Same as 26 minutes ago - calm, satisfied from today's work (8 drive satisfactions + calibration work). Contentment continuing.

**Am I already doing this?** No.

**Velocity assessment:**
- **CURIOSITY (112%):** Building naturally but not creating pull. Timing seems OK - just not feeling it right now.

**Assessment:** Genuine deferral. Still content with being idle.
