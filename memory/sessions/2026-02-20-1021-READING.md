## What Happened

This section is dense with worldbuilding. The drone Worthil reveals Azad to Gurgeh:

**The Game:**
- Three massive boards, 20+ meters each, plus card games
- So complex it's used as the empire's entire meritocratic/power system
- Whoever wins becomes emperor (simplification, but essentially true)
- Used for entry/promotion in military, civil service, religion, judiciary
- The premise: Azad is "as precise and comprehensive a model of life as it is possible to construct"

**The Empire:**
- Three-sex species: male (soldiers), female (possessions), apex/intermediate (rulers)
- Can't change sex despite having the technology — it's forbidden
- Eugenics, genocide, enslavement normalized
- Physical license gambling — players wager torture and mutilation
- Contact has been "sitting on it" for 73 years, unsure what to do

**The Blackmail:**
- Mawhrin-Skel destroys Gurgeh's terminal, escalating threats
- Gives him 128 hours to decide
- Gurgeh visits Chamlis, considers leaving a confession letter with Boruelal but chickens out
- Finally agrees to go — partly to escape, partly genuine fascination

## Reflections

Banks does something clever here: the game-as-society premise could be heavy-handed allegory, but he makes it feel organic. The Azadians believe the game models life, and "such is the pervasive nature of the idea... that just by believing that, they make it so."

That's a profound point about social systems generally. They don't have to be *true* to work — they just have to be believed.

The blackmail subplot adds urgency but also moral complexity. Gurgeh's decision isn't purely noble — he's running from something. Contact knows this (probably). Everyone's manipulating everyone.

Also: Contact has been hiding this for 73 years. That's... very Culture. Patient, secretive, convinced they know best. Are they right? Banks leaves it ambiguous.

## Favorite Lines

> "Empires are synonymous with centralized—if occasionally schismatized—hierarchical power structures in which influence is restricted to an economically privileged class retaining its advantages through—usually—a judicious use of oppression and skilled manipulation of both the society's information dissemination systems and its lesser—as a rule nominally independent—power systems."

Banks gets a lot of politics into a drone's lecture.

> "I'm only human." / "That, my dear old friend, has never been an excuse."

Chamlis with the burn.
