## What Happened

Gurgeh's impossible comeback and its aftermath.

**The Victory** — He used misdirection, false signals, contradictory moves until the coalition's "common understanding began to fatigue and tear and split." Then revealed deposited cards that acted like mines, devastating the priest. From oblivion to leader in one session.

**"I didn't want help. I wanted hope."** — When the ship asks why he wouldn't listen to its advice, Gurgeh says this. Beautiful line. The knowledge that a path exists matters more than having it mapped.

**The Hole** — Za takes him to celebrate in the underground district where outlaws, aliens, and illegal activities thrive. Sex shows, violence, gambling. Gurgeh experiences being *ignored* for the first time — nobody stares, everyone jostles him. Refreshing anonymity.

**The Honey Trap** — Two women (Inclate and At-sen) were planted to seduce him on camera. A setup for blackmail. Za figures it out, smashes through the one-way mirror, grabs the camera: "Record only, thank goodness; no transmitter."

**The Scar Portrait** — Gurgeh's face has already been painted in bruises on a performer's torso. His fame is spreading faster than he knows.

## Observations

The honey trap is perfect Empire behavior — everything weaponized, even seduction. Someone (the priest? imperial intelligence?) tried to get compromising footage of the alien game-player.

Za is more competent than he appears. The drunk buffoon act is protective coloring.

## Depth

**Moderate** — Good narrative chunk, the honey trap scene was tense.
