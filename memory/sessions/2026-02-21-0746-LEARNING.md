# Session: LEARNING
**Date:** 2026-02-21 07:46
**Drive:** LEARNING (24%)

## What Happened

Deep conversation with Dan about aspirations architecture gap. Started with "does nightly build add aspirations?" and evolved into:

1. Current system is vibes-based (3am Claude instance guessing from cold transcripts)
2. Real gap: drive sessions don't know about aspirations
3. Discovery problem: if I find a new aspiration mid-exploration, how do I capture it?
4. Tool awareness: `aspire` CLI isn't in TOOLS.md, so I might forget I have it

## What We Designed

Two-part fix emerging:
- **Sync script** outputs current aspirations alongside drives (awareness of what exists)
- **DRIVES-ENGAGEMENT.md** includes capture workflow (know when/how to add new ones)

This closes the loop: see existing aspirations → engage with drives → discover new aspiration → capture immediately → nightly reviews and cleans up

## What I Noticed

Dan's questions cut through to the real architectural gaps. "But how would it know unless your big brain was guiding it?" - that's the cold start problem. "What if during exploration you discover another aspiration?" - that's the capture problem. He's designing with me, not just asking.

## Depth

**Moderate** — Real system design work, not surface chat.
