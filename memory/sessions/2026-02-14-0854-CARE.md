## Summary
Ran CARE checklist - no urgent items, infrastructure gaps noted (calendar script, camera pairing).

## Details

**Calendar Check:**
- Script doesn't exist yet (`scripts/check_calendar.py`)
- Need to create calendar integration for future CARE sessions

**Weather Check:**
- London: Sunny, 0°C, light winds
- Nothing notable - normal February day

**Household Check:**
- No paired nodes available for camera access
- Walter check skipped (camera infrastructure not set up)

**Context:**
- Saturday 8:55am - Dan likely at AA homegroup (8:30am Sloane Square)
- No urgent items requiring outreach

**Decision:**
Per instructions: "DON'T message just to say hi — only if you have something useful"
- No outreach needed this session
- Normal weather, no calendar alerts, no household issues

**Infrastructure Needs:**
1. Calendar integration script
2. Camera node pairing for Walter checks
3. Consider home automation status checks

## Artifacts
- Created: memory/sessions/2026-02-14-0854-CARE.md
