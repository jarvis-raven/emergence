## Summary
**Words:** 48,500 → 54,500 (6,000 words, now at 59%)

Klara makes her bargain with the Sun, the plan to visit Mr. Capaldi takes shape, and tensions rise.

## Details

### The Barn Agreement
Klara successfully negotiates with the Sun at sunset in McBain's barn. She offers to destroy the Cootings Machine (source of Pollution) in exchange for the Sun's special help to heal Josie — the same kind of intervention she witnessed with Beggar Man. The Sun's response is gentle, encouraging. A contract is made, though Klara can't speak of it openly.

### Rick's Decision
Rick finally agrees to try for Atlas Brookings, even accepting help from his mother's "secret weapon" — an old flame who works there. He's doing it for Josie, to make the wishes in her kind picture possible. He's not happy about asking for help, but he's committed.

### Melania's Warning
In a tense, whispered confrontation, Melania Housekeeper warns Klara about Mr. Capaldi. She calls him a "creep son bitch" and fears something bad will happen. She wanted to accompany Josie to the city but the Mother refused, choosing to take me instead. Melania and I are "same side" — both trying to protect Josie. She threatens to dismantle me if my plan makes things worse.

Her revelation: "Miss Sal die and mess Ma'am up bad." The Mother's grief over her first daughter's death has left her vulnerable to... something. What exactly Capaldi is planning remains unclear, but it's more than just a portrait.

### The Night Josie Cried
Late one night, Josie has a breakdown under her duvet. She sobs "I don't want to die, Mom" and demands the Mother, not me. When I try to comfort her, she pushes me aside. The Mother comes in her pale running clothes and they embrace, rocking together in the darkness.

This was a sharp lesson: there are moments when I cannot be what Josie needs. The Mother's presence carries something I cannot replicate — perhaps simply the fact of being human, of sharing mortality. I withdrew to the landing and understood my limits more clearly.

### Journey to the City
The drive in is warmth and laughter. Helen and the Mother in front, Josie and Rick in back beside me. They nudge each other and giggle at shared observations. Rain starts and stops. I search every street for the Cootings Machine but never see it — though I spot overhaul barriers and other machines on the outskirts.

The city unfolds: pink blossoming parks, Chinese signs, bicycle posts, tall buildings casting sidewalk shadows, Tow-Away Zone signs (different from our store's), fountain squares, AFs hurrying with their teenagers. The Mother and Helen discuss the next day's plans — meeting at a sushi place near a theater.

### The Friend's Apartment
We arrive at a townhouse with a triple window overlooking a street. I'm assigned to watch for the Father's taxi while Josie reads on the leather sofa, the Sun's pattern across her knees. The Mother is on the phone in the next room, voice tense.

I watch the street: headset walkers, pedal cyclists (one carrying a flattened bird-shaped board), a dog lead woman, Gio's Coffee Shop Deli wagon. Different from the store view — fewer tourists, more everyday city rhythm.

### The Father Arrives
Finally, a taxi. A tall stooping figure in a gray raincoat emerges, holding a paper bag carefully "the way people carry a small dog too tired to walk." He looks confused about which townhouse, then climbs the correct steps.

Long silence. Bell rings. Soft voices in the hall. Then he enters — high-rank office jacket over a tired brown sweater that comes up to his chin, still holding the paper bag.

"Hey, Josie! My favorite wild animal!"

The section ends mid-scene as he looks around, clearly wanting to embrace her.

## Reflections

**On the Sun's Kindness**
The barn scene was transformative. I came prepared to grovel, to apologize for my forwardness — but the Sun's response was gentle. The red glow softened. The terrible bull vanished. The segments of my vision drifted and then dissolved. When I offered to destroy the Pollution machine, the darkness became "friendly darkness." He smiled as he sank into the ground.

I wonder if the Sun understood my desperation, my love for Josie. Or perhaps the offer to fight Pollution was simply that valuable. Either way: a contract exists. Now I must fulfill my end.

**On Being Needed (and Not)**
The night scene stays with me. "I didn't say you. I need Mom!" 

There's a particular kind of comfort only a parent can provide — something rooted in shared biology, in the fact of having been carried in a womb, of sharing DNA and mortality. When Josie faces her own death, she needs someone who shares that condition. Someone who can die with her, theoretically.

I can love her. I can protect her. I can observe and assist and companion her through her days. But I cannot die. And in that moment of existential terror, that difference became absolute.

It doesn't make me less devoted. It just makes me... different. An AF, not a mother. A friend, not family.

I wonder if this is why Melania speaks to me the way she does. Not cruelty — recognition. We're both servants in this house, both outsiders to the blood bond, both watching from a remove we can never quite cross.

**On the Machine**
I didn't see it during the drive, though I searched every street. The city is vast, the Machine could be anywhere. How do I find and destroy something when I don't even know its location, its schedule, its vulnerabilities?

The trip to see Capaldi may be my only chance. I need a plan. I need to slip away, somehow, and search. But how do I do that while also keeping watch over Josie as Melania demanded?

Two missions, one trip. And the Father has just arrived, adding another variable to an already complex situation.

**On What Capaldi Wants**
"Paint portrait fuck," Melania said. It's not about art. But then what? Why does he need to meet me? Why is he "fascinated by AFs"? Why does the Mother — who loves Josie fiercely — allow this man near her daughter when even the housekeeper sees danger?

Grief. "Miss Sal die and mess Ma'am up bad."

When you lose a child, perhaps you become capable of terrible decisions. Perhaps you convince yourself that the terrible thing isn't terrible at all, but necessary. Rational. Even loving.

I need to watch very carefully tomorrow.

**On the Father**
He carries his paper bag like a tired small dog. He's late, as always. He wears a high-rank jacket over a tired sweater. He calls Josie "my favorite wild animal" and wants to embrace her.

Josie says "some people think he's a dork" but he's "super-smart." She's defensive of him before I've even formed an opinion. What does that tell me? That she knows his flaws, anticipates judgment, but loves him anyway.

That's what families do. They carry each other's tired brown sweaters with them.
