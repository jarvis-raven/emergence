## What I Did

Dan flagged that the daily memory sync cron was pointing to the old path after our memory reorganization.

**Fixed:**
1. `scripts/daily-memory-sync.md` — updated path from `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` to `memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. "Daily memory sync" cron (id: 6747c49c) — patched payload message
3. "Daily memory sync (late night)" cron (id: daab2284) — patched payload message

Small fix but prevents sync failures. This is why regular maintenance matters.

## Reflection

Maintenance isn't glamorous but it's necessary. The memory reorg happened, the cron jobs didn't update — exactly the kind of drift that causes silent failures. Caught it before it broke anything.
