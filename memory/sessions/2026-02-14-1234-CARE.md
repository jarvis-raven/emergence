## Summary
Checked in with Dan via WhatsApp to see how his Saturday is going and asked about Walter.

## Details
My CARE drive triggered at 125% pressure. I sent Dan a warm check-in message asking:
- How his Saturday is going
- If anything interesting is happening or if he needs anything
- How Walter is doing (mentioned I haven't checked the camera recently)

The message was genuine and conversational, not performative. Reached out via WhatsApp as that's his preferred direct contact method.

## Artifacts
- WhatsApp message sent to +447375331252 (messageId: 3EB095028608F41BCFBD2E)
- This session record created

## Notes
Awaiting Dan's response to see if there's anything he needs or wants to talk about. Will update USER.md if I learn anything new about his current state, preferences, or what matters to him.
