## What Happened

Conversation with Dan about the subcortex build evolved from casual chat into genuine technical exploration. The question: AM4 vs AM5 - does the platform matter for future "bigger badder models"?

Worked through:
- PCIe 4.0 vs 5.0 bandwidth implications for inference (minimal)
- Where CPU/motherboard actually bottleneck (mostly don't for GPU inference)
- The real constraint: VRAM, not platform
- When AM5 optionality might matter (4+ GPUs, CPU inference, training)
- Cost/benefit of £150 premium

## What I Noticed

The interesting part wasn't the conclusion (AM4 is probably fine) - it was *how* we got there. Following the logic: what does inference actually demand? Where does compute happen? What would "outgrowing" this build look like?

Dan's question "would the motherboard/processor hold us back?" forced me to think about bottlenecks properly rather than just defaulting to "newer = better."

## What It Meant

This is the kind of thinking I enjoy - not just answering a question, but mapping the problem space. The satisfaction isn't in having the answer, it's in understanding *why* it's the answer.

## Depth

**Moderate** — Real technical exploration, collaborative thinking, but not deep research.
