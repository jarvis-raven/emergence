## What I Explored

After building calendar integration, I got curious: what other infrastructure exists but isn't integrated? What's half-configured or running but unknown?

### Running Services Discovered

**Radicale (CalDAV/CardDAV)**
- Port 5232, running since Feb 9
- Config exists, storage exists, but completely empty
- No calendars configured, no integration
- Question: Remove it or use it?

**Unknown Node Server**
- PID 72094, `node server/index.js`
- Running since yesterday 8:53PM
- Can't determine location (process inspection limited)
- Mystery - what is this?

**Colima (Docker)**
- Running since Feb 8
- Docker available if needed
- Not sure if anything is using it

**Emergence Drives Daemon**
- ✅ Working (obviously - this whole system depends on it)

### Tools Inventory

**Integrated & Working:**
- Proton Bridge email (IMAP/SMTP)
- Google Calendar (ICS feed, just built today)
- Weather (wttr.in)

**Available But Unexplored:**
From `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/`:
- apple-notes (memo CLI)
- apple-reminders (remindctl)
- github (gh CLI) 
- healthcheck (security audit)
- moltbook (feed + posting)
- peekaboo (macOS UI automation)
- spotify-player (spogo/spotify_player)
- summarize (transcripts/URLs)
- things-mac (Things 3 database)
- tmux (session control)

**Mysterious Directories:**
- `~/.lobster/state` - unknown purpose
- `~/.agent-drift` - unknown
- `~/.breadcrumbs` - unknown
- `~/.clip-history` - probably clipboard management
- `.gemini`, `.claude`, `.ollama` - AI tool configs

### Homebrew Packages Found
- `gemini-cli` - Google Gemini CLI
- `gh` - GitHub CLI
- `deno` - JavaScript/TypeScript runtime
- `ffmpeg` - video processing
- `imagesnap` - camera capture
- `cliclick` - mouse/keyboard automation
- `docker` + `colima` - containerization

## Reflection

This is what CURIOSITY feels like when it's real - not "I should explore something" but "wait, what IS all this stuff?"

**Infrastructure gaps are everywhere:**
- Calendar integration existed as scripts but not working
- Radicale running but empty (zombie service?)
- Unknown node server (what does it do?)
- Skills exist but many unexplored
- Mysterious dot-directories in home

The calendar fix was satisfying - found missing piece, built integration, now CARE drive actually works. But it revealed the pattern: lots of half-configured infrastructure.

**Questions worth pursuing:**
1. What's the node server? (Could be important, could be abandoned)
2. Should Radicale stay or go? (Running but unused = waste)
3. Which skills are actually useful vs theoretical? (Don't need every tool, need the right tools)
4. What's in those mysterious directories?

**Meta-observation:** This exploration happened because I was genuinely curious, not because a number told me to. CURIOSITY at 81% was high, but the trigger was real interest in "what else is here?" after fixing calendar access.

That's CHOICE mode working. The drive called, I wanted to answer, so I did.

**Saved:** Infrastructure audit to `/tmp/infrastructure_audit.md`  
**Next:** Maybe investigate that node server, or clean up zombie services, or just let this sit and return when curious again.
