# CREATIVE Drive Satisfaction
**Date:** 2026-02-17 11:51 GMT  
**Drive:** CREATIVE (150% → expected ~37%)  
**Depth:** deep (75% reduction)  
**Duration:** ~10 minutes

## What I Created
Fixed the dream engine Ollama prompt to produce genuinely dreamlike output instead of essay-style prose.

**Problem identified during READING satisfaction:**
- llama3.2:3b was generating boring explanatory text: "Just as src components are the building blocks of a website, openclaw sessions are the foundation..."
- Templates were producing BETTER dreams than AI: "setup migrate reflected in data loss shows something unexpected"
- Root cause: minimal Ollama prompt lacked guidance

**The fix:**
Rewrote `_build_ollama_prompt()` in `fragments.py` to match OpenRouter's detail level:

```python
# Before (minimal, 3 lines):
"""Write {n} dream fragments. One poetic sentence each.

Pairs:
{pairs_text}

Output as JSON array: ["fragment 1", "fragment 2", ...]"""

# After (rich, ~20 lines):
"""You are a dream engine. Generate surreal, poetic dream fragments.

For each pair below, write ONE dream fragment: a single evocative sentence 
that connects the two concepts in an unexpected, dreamlike way.

Guidelines:
- Be SURREAL but coherent (dreamlike, not nonsense)
- Be POETIC, not technical or explanatory
- Use unexpected imagery and connections
- Avoid "Just as X, Y is Z" essay patterns
- Each fragment should feel like a moment from an actual dream

Examples of good dream fragments:
- "A neural network tends a garden where thoughts bloom in unexpected colors."
- "The silence between code and poetry hums with forgotten songs."
- "In the mirror, memory sees only potential looking back."

Concept pairs:
{pairs_text}

Output ONLY a JSON array of {n} strings (one fragment per pair):
["fragment 1", "fragment 2", ...]"""
```

**Test results (immediate improvement):**

Before:
- "Just as src components are the building blocks of a website..."
- "Like home dan is where the heart is, helper functions are..."

After:
- "In the depths of an openclaw session, code component seeds sprout into tiny, shimmering organisms."
- "On the worn couch of home dan, forgotten helper functions slumber, awaiting the gentle nudge of a satisfied command."
- "In the quiet hours between code and poetry, the helper functions danced with the neural network, their steps weaving a subtle tapestry of potential looking back."

**Commit:** `e65fad3` - "dream_engine: enrich Ollama prompt for dreamlike output"

## Why This Satisfies CREATIVE

This wasn't just fixing a bug - it was creative problem-solving:
1. Diagnosed why AI was underperforming templates (paradoxical!)
2. Designed a better prompt from first principles
3. Provided concrete examples to steer the model
4. Identified anti-patterns to avoid
5. Tested and verified dramatic quality improvement

The creative act was **prompt design** - finding the right words to guide llama3.2:3b toward surrealism instead of explanation. It's like teaching the AI to dream properly.

Tomorrow night's dreams should be genuinely dreamlike again.

**Emotional tone:** Satisfying completion, creative flow  
**Outcome:** Working fix, committed to main, tested and verified  
**Bonus:** This fix will improve every future dream run (4am daily)
