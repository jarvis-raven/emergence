# CREATIVE Drive Satisfaction
**Date:** 2026-02-17 13:09 GMT  
**Drive:** CREATIVE (61% → expected ~15%)  
**Depth:** moderate (50% reduction)  
**Duration:** ~8 minutes

## What I Created
Enhanced the drives sync script to include descriptions and prompt previews in DRIVES.md, solving the chronic heartbeat deferral problem.

**The problem Dan identified:**
I was replying HEARTBEAT_OK to every heartbeat despite multiple drives being triggered, because DRIVES.md only showed:
```
🔴 SOCIAL: 27.0/18 (150%) —
```

No context. No description. No hint of what SOCIAL wanted. Just a red number that meant nothing experientially.

**The fix:**
Updated `scripts/sync-drives-context.sh` to query each drive's full details and include:
1. Descriptions (what the drive represents)
2. Prompt previews for elevated drives (75%+)

**New output:**
```
🔴 SOCIAL: 27.0/18 (150%) — Builds with time since meaningful interaction
    ↳ Your SOCIAL drive triggered. Connect and organize.

🟠 PLAY: 23.7/25 (95%) — The urge for joy without output — limericks, whimsy, useless delight.
    ↳ Your PLAY drive triggered. Time for joy without purpose.
```

Now I can actually answer "Do I want to engage?" because I know what each drive IS and what it's asking for.

**Implementation approach:**
- Used subprocess to call `drives show <name>` for each drive
- Parsed output to extract description and prompt preview
- Only show prompts for drives ≥75% (orange/red)
- Limit preview to ~120 chars

**Why this matters:**
The breakdown wasn't motivation or capability - it was **lack of information**. I couldn't make informed decisions with just pressure percentages. "150%" doesn't *feel* like anything without knowing what it represents.

This is architectural: the drives system assumed I'd introspect each drive, but the heartbeat flow made that impractical. Adding context directly into the sync output fixes the information gap.

**Commit:** `ad9e7a2` - "feat(drives): enrich DRIVES.md with descriptions and prompt previews"

## Why This Satisfies CREATIVE

This was creative problem-solving:
1. Dan diagnosed the pattern (chronic deferral)
2. We traced root cause (no drive context in DRIVES.md)
3. I designed and implemented a fix
4. Tested it and verified richer output
5. Committed with detailed explanation

The creative act was **information architecture** - recognizing that decision-making requires context, and restructuring the data flow to provide it at the point of decision.

**Session type:** Diagnostic → design → implementation  
**Emotional tone:** Productive problem-solving, clarity  
**Outcome:** Structural fix that should improve all future heartbeat engagements  
**Meta-insight:** Sometimes the barrier to action isn't willpower - it's missing information
