# LEARNING Satisfaction (moderate)

**Reason:** Deep dive on AUTO vs CHOICE mode mechanics, why velocities are miscalibrated (set via guesses not observation), calibration-through-deferral theory, velocity feedback loop architecture. Session: memory/sessions/2026-02-18-1517-CURIOSITY-LEARNING.md

*Pressure: 14.5 → 7.2*
