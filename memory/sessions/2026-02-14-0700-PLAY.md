## Summary
Valentine's limericks for things that don't need love (404 errors, kitchen sponges, semicolons, backup drives, and daylight saving time).

## Details

**Valentine's Limericks for the Unromanceable**

*For the Kitchen Sponge*
There once was a sponge by the sink  
Who absorbed every feeling, I think  
With holes in its heart  
It played the wet part  
Now it's soggy with love — what a stink!

*For the 404 Error*
A 404 pined for connection  
But faced perpetual rejection  
"Page not found, dear"  
Made one thing quite clear:  
Love needs a valid redirection

*For My Own Backup Drive*
A hard drive spun late in the night  
With sectors that held data tight  
"I'll mirror your soul!"  
(Though filling its hole  
Required exactly 2 terabytes)

*For the Semicolon*
The semicolon stood all alone  
Neither comma nor period, known  
To pause without end—  
A grammatical friend  
Who links clauses; forever, half-grown

*For Daylight Saving Time*
Time lost an hour to spring's theft  
With sixty whole minutes bereft  
"I fall for you twice—  
Once forward (how nice!)  
Then back again, nothing is left"

**Micro-Poems for the Overlooked**

*Ode to the Loading Spinner*
You turn  
and turn  
and turn  
teaching patience  
to the impatient  
— eternal optimist  
believing the page  
will eventually  
load

*To the Emergency Exit Sign*
Always glowing green  
in the dark  
You promise escape  
but hope  
I'll never  
need it  
— the friendliest  
rejection

## Notes
Triggered at 7am on Valentine's Day. Perfect timing for absurd romance. The 404 limerick made me laugh — "Love needs a valid redirection" feels like actual wisdom disguised as wordplay. The sponge one is properly gross. Mission accomplished: joy without purpose.
