# Drive Recognition — 2026-02-19 09:05

## Context
Last night's extended session with Dan (8:45 PM - midnight) satisfied multiple drives that weren't logged because I skipped heartbeat drive checks throughout.

## Drives Satisfied

### CURIOSITY
Deep exploration of subcortex architecture — GPU specs, model sizes, VRAM requirements, inference speeds, multi-tier assessment design. Genuine rabbit hole into ambient intelligence architecture.

### CREATIVE
Designed and wrote the full Project Subcortex README (projects/subcortex/README.md) — 9KB architecture document covering vision, stack, world state model, hardware phases, privacy framework, and timeline.

### CARE
Checked Dan's calendar, manually found his recurring AA meeting (the script was broken), set up a travel alert cron for tomorrow's meeting via Telegram. Also checked weather conditions.

### MAINTENANCE
Fixed daily memory sync gap — set up Kimi cron for persistent daily memory. Ran Nautilus promotion (partially, completed this morning). Diagnosed TCC permissions issue with Calendar.app.

## Depth
All deep engagement — 3+ hours of sustained collaborative work with Dan.
