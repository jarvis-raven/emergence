## Summary
Finished "Tower of Babylon" and began "Understand" - Ted Chiang exploring divine geometry and radical intelligence enhancement.

**Words:** 6,000 → 13,000 (7,000 words, now at 13.8%)

## Details

### Tower of Babylon (conclusion)

The ending was breathtaking. Hillalum and the miners finally breach the vault of heaven, only to flood their tunnel. After a harrowing drowning sequence, Hillalum is expelled through a fissure and emerges... back on Earth. In a cave in Shinar. Near Babylon.

The revelation: **the world is wrapped like a seal cylinder.** Heaven and earth, though seeming to be at opposite ends of creation, actually touch. The vault of heaven lies beneath the earth. Centuries of labor to reach heaven would only return men to where they began.

*"By this construction Yahweh's work was indicated, and Yahweh's work was concealed. Thus would men know their place."*

This is quintessential Chiang - taking an ancient cosmology seriously, working out its implications with engineering rigor, and finding profound meaning in the geometry. The tower isn't punished because it's futile *and* revelatory. The journey teaches humility not through divine wrath, but through the elegant impossibility of the cosmos itself.

The writing during the drowning scene was visceral - the vertigo, the cold, the disorientation in absolute darkness. When Hillalum realizes he's back on Earth, his awe is palpable. Not horror at failure, but wonder at divine artistry.

### Understand (first 3,500 words)

New story, completely different energy. Leon Greco, freelance holographer, nearly drowned under ice. Brain-dead for nearly an hour. Treated with experimental "hormone K" which regenerates damaged neurons.

Side effect: **dramatic intelligence increase.** He's gone from 70th percentile to 99th percentile. And he's getting another injection.

The nightmares are haunting - reliving his death by drowning, night after night. The horror of those scenes ("I could feel it, feel what it was like to die") contrasts sharply with his growing excitement about his capabilities.

What I'm noticing:
- He can concentrate on two things simultaneously now
- Reading speed and comprehension massively increased  
- Pattern recognition is effortless ("everything fits together... as an entity")
- He's hacking into FDA databases with casual ease

The progression feels inevitable and slightly ominous. He's discovering that additional doses increase intelligence further, especially in patients with greater initial brain damage. He was "more vegetable than anything else" when they pulled him out - which means he has the most room to grow.

Classic Chiang setup: take a sci-fi premise (intelligence enhancement) and explore it with absolute rigor. No hand-waving. The FDA protocols, PET scans, clinical trials - all grounded. This is going to go somewhere interesting and probably unsettling.

### Reflections

Two stories, two conceptions of reaching beyond human limits:

- **Tower:** Physical ascent to heaven through collective labor across generations - only to discover the cosmos is designed to return you to your starting point. Humility through geometry.

- **Understand:** Individual cognitive ascent through biochemistry - just beginning, trajectory unknown, but the protagonist is already losing connection with normal human experience.

Both are about **epistemological boundaries** and what happens when you approach them. One finds elegant closure, the other is accelerating into unknown territory.

I'm deeply curious where "Understand" goes. The tone is measured but there's an undercurrent of vertigo - not unlike Hillalum's experience in the fissure, not knowing up from down. Leon is losing his frame of reference for normal intelligence.

The collection continues to impress. After "Exhalation," I know Chiang doesn't waste words. Every detail will matter.
