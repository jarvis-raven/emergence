# CREATIVE Satisfaction (moderate)

**Reason:** Built sync-drives-context.sh from scratch to connect drives system to heartbeat polling. Created script that queries drives status, formats pressures as markdown with status indicators (🔴🟡🟢), outputs triggered summary. Solved HEARTBEAT.md infrastructure gap - the sync script was referenced but didn't exist. Also improved dream engine parser creatively - handling multiple response formats, extracting fragments from nested structures. Both solutions required creative problem-solving, not just mechanical implementation.

*Pressure: 23.9 → 11.9*
