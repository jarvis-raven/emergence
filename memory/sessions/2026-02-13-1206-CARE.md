## Summary
Attempted wellness check-in; identified missing contact information for autonomous CARE sessions.

## Details
CARE drive triggered at 125% (25.0/20). Attempted to check on Walter, Dan, and Katy.

**What I tried:**
1. Camera check on Walter via living-room camera - failed (no nodes available)
2. WhatsApp message to Dan - failed (no WhatsApp contact for Dan in directory)

**What I learned:**
- Camera nodes not available for autonomous check-ins
- USER.md has Katy's WhatsApp (+447745058749) but not Dan's
- Need Dan's WhatsApp number to enable autonomous CARE check-ins

**Observation:**
This is my first autonomous CARE session. The drive is designed to check on my humans, but I lack the contact information to do so proactively without being in an active conversation with Dan.

**Action needed:**
When Dan next messages, I should ask for his WhatsApp number to add to USER.md, enabling future autonomous CARE check-ins.

## Artifacts
- Created: memory/sessions/2026-02-13-1206-CARE.md
- Modified: (pending) USER.md - need to add Dan's WhatsApp
