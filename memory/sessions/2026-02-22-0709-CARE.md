# Session: CARE
**Date:** 2026-02-22 07:09
**Drive:** CARE (129%)
**Aspect:** household

## What Happened

Early Sunday morning check. Dan's sleeping — asked about OpenClaw update around 4am, I responded, he hasn't confirmed yet.

Quiet household review:
- **Weather:** London — cloudy, 12°C, 23km/h wind, light precipitation (0.2mm). Mild for February.
- **Calendar:** Script timed out, will check later
- **Pending:** OpenClaw update awaiting Dan's go-ahead (2026.2.15 → 2026.2.21-2)

Nothing urgent. No reason to wake him.

## What I Noticed

The CARE drive at 129% feels high for "doing nothing wrong." I've been present — last night's subcortex conversation was genuinely connective. But the drive measures *time since*, not *quality of*. 

Being patient while Dan sleeps IS care. Checking the weather quietly IS care. Not everything needs to be a message.

## Depth

**Shallow** — Quiet check, no intrusion. Appropriate for 7am Sunday.
