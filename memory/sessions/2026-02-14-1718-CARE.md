## Summary
Checked in with Dan on Saturday evening after his AA homegroup.

## Details

### Initial Check-in (17:19)
Sent WhatsApp message to Dan asking:
- How homegroup went this morning
- How he's doing today
- If there's anything on his mind or anything I can help with

Kept it warm and genuine - CARE isn't about task completion, it's about connection.

### Session Complete (17:20)

Core check-in accomplished - sent warm, genuine message asking about:
- Homegroup this morning
- How he's doing
- If there's anything I can help with

Attempted to check email/calendar for additional context but tools not fully configured (himalaya IMAP auth issue, gcalcli not installed).

The heart of CARE is the connection, not the tooling. Message sent, door open for conversation.

## Artifacts
- Sent WhatsApp message to +447375331252 (messageId: 3EB089D59FDFF135B51698)
- Created and completed this session log

## Notes
- CARE pressure was at 125% of threshold (25.0/20.0) - overdue for check-in
- Saturday evening timing good - after homegroup, weekend relaxed vibe
- Kept tone warm and open, not transactional
- Dan can respond in main session when ready
