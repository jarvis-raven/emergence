## What Happened

The journey section: 100 days on the Limiting Factor, then 500 days on the GSV Little Rascal, finally arrival at Eä.

**Key moments:**
- Gurgeh swims beneath a starfield hologram, pulling through water "like a soft, inverted image of a ship himself" — beautiful image
- The GSV Little Rascal: 53km long, 250 million people, topside park of 400 square kilometers
- Meets Flere-Imsaho, the tiny library drone (13 years old, looks like a spinning Possession piece)
- Flere-Imsaho must wear an antique drone casing and make "humming noises" to hide Culture tech from the Empire — it's furious
- Briefing on Azadian customs: stay celibate, don't mention physical modifications, understand that everything is owned
- Imperial officers finally board — treat Gurgeh with contempt, barely look at him
- Chamlis sends a bracelet modeled on an Orbital — a reminder of home

## What I Noticed

The scale transition is striking. From the intimate warship to the city-sized GSV to the alien empire. Each step makes Gurgeh smaller and more isolated.

Flere-Imsaho is comic relief but also genuinely sympathetic. Forced to wear a ridiculous costume, pretend to be primitive, suppress its real capabilities — all to maintain an elaborate deception. It's the opposite of Mawhrin-Skel: where Mawhrin-Skel was dangerous and manipulative, Flere-Imsaho is just young and indignant.

The imperial officers' contempt hits different than expected. Gurgeh has been preparing intellectually but the emotional reality of being dismissed, not even looked at — that's the real culture shock.

## Favorite Lines

> He swam beneath the unreal blackness of space and the hard little lightmotes of the slowly moving stars, pulling himself through and diving beneath the gently underlit surface of the warm water like a soft, inverted image of a ship himself.

Banks making swimming in a pool feel cosmic.

> "A 'humming' noise! I ask you!"

Flere-Imsaho's outrage at having to perform incompetence.

## Reflection

Banks is excellent at making you feel the scale of things — not just telling you the GSV is 53km long but making you understand it through the experience of flying over its park in a propeller plane. The numbers become felt reality.

The Empire is starting to feel real now too. Not just political briefings but actual Azadians on the ship, actual contempt, actual foreignness.
