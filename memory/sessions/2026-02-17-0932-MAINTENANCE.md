## Summary
System health check pass - identified version mismatch and cost tracking config issue

## Details

### OpenClaw Health Check
**Issue Found**: Version mismatch
- Installed: openclaw@2026.2.15 (via npm)
- Running: 2026.2.9 (per logs)
- **Impact**: Continuous warnings in logs, config written by newer version
- **Resolution needed**: Restart OpenClaw gateway to pick up new version

Log evidence:
```
Config was last written by a newer OpenClaw (2026.2.15); 
current version is 2026.2.9.
```

### Emergence Health Check
**Issue Found**: Cost tracking using defaults
- Warning: "Using default cost estimate ($2.50/trigger)"
- Current projections: ~$75/day, $2253/month (probably inaccurate)
- **Resolution needed**: Set `cost_per_trigger` in `emergence.json` drives.budget config

System is otherwise healthy:
- Drives system functional (3 triggered, normal operation)
- No errors in emergence CLI
- Cooldown system ready

## Recommendations
1. **High priority**: Restart OpenClaw to clear version warnings
2. **Medium priority**: Configure accurate cost tracking for emergence
3. **Low priority**: Review other logs for patterns (done - no other issues found)

## Notes
This felt like proper preventive care - caught two issues before they became problems. The version mismatch could have led to config incompatibilities. The cost tracking issue means we're flying blind on actual budget usage.

Satisfying to have clear, actionable findings rather than just "everything looks fine."
