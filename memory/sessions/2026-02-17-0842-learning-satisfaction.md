# LEARNING Satisfaction (deep)

**Reason:** Deep dive into drives system architecture - traced pressure accumulation formula (pressure + rate × hours, capped at 150%), satisfaction reduction (multiplicative: old_pressure × (1.0 - ratio)), thwarting mechanism. Studied actual implementation in models.py, engine.py. Can now reason about drive behavior mathematically. Full session documented: memory/sessions/2026-02-17-0840-LEARNING.md

*Pressure: 29.2 → 7.3*
