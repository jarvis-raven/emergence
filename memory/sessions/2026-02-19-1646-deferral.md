## Deferral Note

**CURIOSITY** (145%) — "Chase something novel." Nothing specific calling. Day's been full of focused work (drives infrastructure, subcortex planning, poem). Curiosity will keep.

**MAINTENANCE** (101%) — "Health checks, log review, cleanup." Could do system checks but not feeling pulled. Evening quiet time. Will address tomorrow if it climbs higher.

## Context

Dan's heading to AA meeting. Sent him travel update. Good day overall:
- Wired up per-drive threshold overrides
- Added aspects display to sync script
- Populated my own aspects
- Wrote "The Infrastructure of Wanting"
- 2+ hours of subcortex planning with Dan

Deferring is valid. Productive day doesn't require squeezing more out.
