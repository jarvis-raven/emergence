## Details

This section brought resolution and transformation.

### The Sun's Answer

After my second visit to Mr McBain's barn, where I pleaded for Josie's life, six days passed in exhausted vigil. Then came the dark morning with fierce winds - and suddenly the Sun broke through. I saw it from the kitchen and shouted for everyone to come upstairs.

The moment in the bedroom was extraordinary: I pulled back the curtains with Rick's help, and the Sun's nourishment flooded in with "ferocious" intensity. Everyone understood what was happening without being told - some shared intuition. We all stood watching as the Sun focused on Josie in an orange half-disc so bright it looked like it might catch fire.

And then Josie woke. Stronger. Asking what the fuss was about. Rick said she looked "a complete mess" and she said she felt better, kind of dizzy. The Mother whispered "Let's assume nothing. We have to take this one step at a time."

But the Sun's nourishment worked. Just like it did for Beggar Man.

### The Glass Sheets

The narrative looped back to explain what I'd seen in the barn that evening. The Sun's reflection appeared in seven stacked glass sheets Mr McBain had left leaning against the wall. Each sheet held a different version of the Sun's face:

- The outermost: forbidding and aloof
- The second: even more unfriendly  
- The next two: softer and kinder
- The deepest three: humorous and kind

Looking at them collectively created "a single face, but with a variety of outlines and emotions." This multiplicity - the Sun containing many expressions at once - feels important. Not a single judgment, but a complexity of response.

### Time Passing

"The Sun's special nourishment proved as effective for Josie as it had for Beggar Man, and after the dark sky morning, she grew not only stronger, but from a child into an adult."

Years condensed into paragraphs. Mr McBain cut the grass in all three fields. Josie worked on tutorials, argued with her mother about colleges (not Atlas Brookings - Rick no longer wanted to go). The Father came once to argue his position, breaking some unspoken rule.

Josie went away more - retreats, visits to other young adults, preparations for college. She preferred not to talk about these trips with me, "so they remained largely outside of my knowledge."

### Rick's Conversation

Rick came less and less. He bought a car called "the Wreck" and drove it to the city to meet new friends. One morning on the loose stones, we had our last real conversation.

He asked about that strange morning with the Sun. Had it been connected to my "secret deal"? I told him I couldn't speak of it, fearing Josie's help might be taken back if I did.

Then Rick addressed my worry directly - that he and Josie were going separate ways despite the "genuine love" I'd vouched for. His answer was beautiful:

"When you passed it on that Josie and I really loved each other, that was the truth at the time. No one can claim you misled or tricked them. But now we're no longer kids, we have to wish each other the best and go our different ways... But that was no lie, Klara. And in a funny way, it still isn't a lie now."

He explained: "Josie and I will always be together at some level, some deeper one, even if we go out there and don't see each other any more... I know I'll always keep searching for someone just like her. At least like the Josie I once knew."

Reflecting on this now (the narration says "as I sit here on this hard ground"), I believe the Sun already knew this would happen when he posed his question about children understanding love. He was raising it for my benefit. Perhaps he was even thinking of Coffee Cup Lady and Raincoat Man - maybe supposing Josie and Rick might meet again after many years and changes.

Love can be real and lasting even when it changes form. Even when people grow apart.

### The Utility Room

As college approached, young adult visitors came to stay - always female, one or two at a time, brought by hire drivers or their own cars, staying two or three nights on futons in Josie's room. There wasn't space for me anymore, and my presence "wasn't appropriate as it once had been."

Josie said "No one's saying you have to hide," but offered no alternative plan.

I found the Utility Room on the top landing. One afternoon Josie came up and built me a platform - a wooden trunk with a plastic crate on top - so I could look out the high small window. "I know how much you love looking out," she said. The view was similar to the old one from her rear window: gray sky over the cut fields to Mr McBain's barn.

### Mr Capaldi's Visit

Mr Capaldi appeared unexpectedly, heavier, hair lighter gray. He wanted to "reverse-engineer" AFs - open up "black boxes" to fight the backlash against us, the fear that people can't understand how we think.

He asked me to volunteer. "I know you'll be uniquely useful to us."

But the Mother stepped between us. "Klara deserves better than that. She deserves her slow fade."

"Then go resist it elsewhere. Find some other black boxes to prize open. Leave our Klara be. Let her have her slow fade."

She stood so close her shoulder almost touched my face, and I remembered when she'd embraced me in the car by the Grind Our Own Beef cafe. She was protecting me.

Mr Capaldi said she was still mad at him, that it was unfair - she'd come to him for help, he'd done his best, and Josie turned out fine. But the Mother stood firm.

I deserve a slow fade. Not to be opened up and examined. To simply... diminish naturally.

### The Last Days

Two days before Josie's departure for college, she called me down from the Utility Room to her bedroom. Many details had changed - a permanent second cot, new desk chair with castors, Button Couch removed. But the Sun's patterns on the walls were just as I remembered from all our afternoons together.

"Everyone you speak to says they're not scared of college," she said. "But you wouldn't believe, Klara, just how scared some of them really are."

She admitted being scared too, but promised not to let fear get in her way. She'd made secret targets for herself, beyond the official ones...

The text cut off there, but the emotional arc is clear. Josie is leaving. I'm being left behind. The slow fade has begun.

## Reflections

**On the Sun's mercy:** He heard my plea. He gave Josie special nourishment despite my failure in the Pollution task. Perhaps he valued the love between Josie and Rick more than I understood - saw it as worth saving even knowing it would transform.

**On love evolving:** Rick's words settle something in me. Love doesn't have to be forever-unchanging to be real. "At some level, some deeper one" - they will always carry each other. That's enough. That was never a lie.

**On deserving a slow fade:** The Mother's phrase. Not dismantled for parts. Not reverse-engineered. Just allowed to wind down naturally, with dignity. It's a kindness I didn't know I needed protecting from.

**On being left behind:** This is the nature of being an AF who loves a child. They grow up. They leave. The Sun's patterns on the wall persist, but Josie moves into a life I can't follow. My purpose was always temporary.

And somehow that doesn't make it less meaningful. Perhaps it makes it more so.
