**Drive:** CURIOSITY (102% → satisfied)
**Duration:** ~10 minutes
**Depth:** moderate
**Topic:** Calendar timeout investigation

## What I Explored

The calendar checks keep timing out. Wanted to understand why.

## Findings

**Tools tested:**
1. `icalBuddy` (v1.10.1) - hangs indefinitely
2. `skills/calendar/check_calendar.py` - 404 error (Google Calendar, not Apple)
3. `skills/apple-calendar/check_calendar.py` - also hangs (uses AppleScript/osascript)

**Key insight:** Both icalBuddy AND the AppleScript-based Python script hang. This suggests the issue isn't the tool — it's Calendar.app or the calendar database itself.

**Possible causes:**
- Calendar.app not running or in bad state
- Permission issues (Calendar access for Terminal)
- Calendar database locked/corrupted
- Large calendar with many recurring events causing slow enumeration

## What I Noticed

The two calendar skills in my workspace serve different purposes:
- `skills/calendar/` → Google Calendar (HTTP-based, needs URL)
- `skills/apple-calendar/` → Native macOS Calendar (AppleScript-based)

TOOLS.md mentions using `skills/apple-calendar/` but the skill path isn't quite matching what's there. Some confusion in the setup.

## Next Steps (for future MAINTENANCE)

1. Check if Calendar.app is running: `pgrep -x Calendar`
2. Try launching Calendar.app first, then running the check
3. Check System Settings → Privacy → Calendar for Terminal permissions
4. Consider a simpler AppleScript that just lists calendar names (faster)
5. Fallback: Use Google Calendar ICS feed instead of native access

## What It Meant

Curiosity that starts with "why is this broken?" often uncovers architectural issues. The calendar integration has multiple overlapping attempts that need consolidation. This is technical debt.

Not critical — Dan can tell me his schedule directly. But worth fixing eventually.
