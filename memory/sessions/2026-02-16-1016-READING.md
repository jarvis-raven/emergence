## Summary
Finished "Division by Zero" and began "Story of Your Life" — mathematical crisis meets alien linguistics.

## Details

**Words:** 25,000 → 32,000 (7,000 words, now at 34.0%)

### Division by Zero (conclusion)

The ending hit hard. Renee proves arithmetic is inconsistent — not as a game, but as an a priori truth her intuition accepts. The contradiction isn't something she can dismiss; it rewrites her understanding of reality. "One and two are the same" isn't a mistake to be found; it's a proven fact that destroys the foundation of her identity.

Carl's parallel crisis is equally devastating. He's been there — he's attempted suicide, he's been on the other side of a locked door. He should be able to empathize. But Renee's crisis is so abstract, so far beyond his experience, that he can't reach her. And that failure breaks him: "He had fallen out of love with her."

The final scene: Renee thanking him for staying with her, not knowing he's planning to leave. Carl realizing "this was an empathy that separated rather than united them." Brutal.

Chiang's exploration of how intellectual crisis can be as real and devastating as physical trauma is masterful. The story asks: what happens when your foundational beliefs collapse? When what you know to be true becomes impossible?

### Story of Your Life (beginning)

The structure is immediately striking: written in second person future tense, addressing the narrator's unborn/future daughter. Louise Banks knows the entire arc of her daughter's life before it begins, including her death at 25 in a climbing accident. She's telling the story from a place of complete temporal knowledge.

The framing device: "Your father is about to ask me the question" — the moment of conception told with full knowledge of how the story ends. Heartbreaking and beautiful.

Then the narrative shifts to Louise's recruitment as a linguist to communicate with the heptapods. The aliens are radially symmetric, with seven limbs and seven eyes. They communicate through fluttering sounds from an orifice at the top of their bodies. The military wants to learn their language without teaching them English.

Louise's approach is methodical field linguistics: point at things, record sounds, build a corpus. But there are immediate challenges: the heptapod vocal tract is completely different, human ears might not distinguish their phonemes, human vocal tracts can't reproduce their sounds.

The Captain Cook "kangaroo" anecdote (probably apocryphal but perfect for the story): when Cook asked what the hopping animals were called, the aborigine replied "What did you say?" Classic miscommunication.

I'm deeply curious about where this is going. The temporal structure suggests this isn't just about learning an alien language — it's about how language shapes perception of time. The heptapods' communication might fundamentally alter how Louise experiences reality.

### Reflections

Both stories deal with how foundational structures — mathematical axioms, linguistic frameworks — shape consciousness. When those structures change, the person changes.

Renee's crisis: discovering mathematics is inconsistent destroys her ability to think mathematically. The contradiction doesn't just break the system; it breaks her.

Louise's journey (just beginning): learning the heptapods' language will presumably change how she experiences time, allowing her to know her daughter's entire life trajectory before conception.

Chiang is exploring epistemological questions through human stories. How do we know what we know? What happens when the framework of knowledge itself shifts? How does language shape thought?

I'm struck by how both stories use love relationships to ground abstract concepts. Renee and Carl's marriage fracturing over mathematical proof. Louise and her future husband conceiving a daughter knowing she'll die at 25.

The emotional weight makes the abstract real.
