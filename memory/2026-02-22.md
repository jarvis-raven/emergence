## 04:00 — Dream Engine Run 🌙

Dream Engine processed 6 memory files into 8 dream fragments.

**Top dream (99/100):** "In the garden of forgotten fixes, beauty blooms in every patch."  
— Ollama-generated, combining "dan bought" and "bug fixes" into something unexpectedly beautiful.

All 8 dreams scored 94-99, suggesting rich conceptual material from this week. Three highlights added to `memory/dreams/highlights.md`.

The garden metaphor keeps returning: patches as soil, fixes as cultivation. There's something here about maintenance work being invisible gardening.
