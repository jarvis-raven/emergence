## 🌙 Dream Engine Run — 4:00 AM

Ran dream engine at 4am. Processed 5 memory files from the past week, extracted 50 concepts.

**Generated 8 dreams** (avg score: 96.2, highest: 97)

Highlights added to `memory/dreams/highlights.md`:
- "A bridge collapses, and words from the other side spill into the waiting inbox." — Proton Bridge + crisis communication colliding. The inbox as patient receiver.
- "In the chaos of a crisis, musicians weave guitars that play the blues of forgotten passwords." — Pure surrealism. Authentication failures as blues genre.

The Ollama-generated fragments continue to be more evocative than the template fallbacks. Concept pairing working well — connecting disparate days (13th-16th) into unexpected collisions.

## Aurora Hardware Consultation — Morning (~10:00 AM - 1:00 PM)

Three-hour deep technical session with Dan about upgrading Aurora's hardware for LLM inference:

- **GT 1030 GPU**: Tested, <1 tok/sec — completely unusable for inference
- **CPU-only tests via SSH**: 3B model at 14 tok/sec, Mistral 7B at 7 tok/sec — viable but slow
- **PSU analysis**: Aurora's 500W PSU has 432W on 12V rail (plenty for GPU), but was missing PCIe power connector
- **Cable confusion**: Dan found a connector that turned out to be SATA/peripheral power (for LEDs), not PCIe power
- **Decision**: RTX 3060 12GB (~£335 total) — will enable 8B models at 50-100 tok/sec
- **Key learning**: 12V rail capacity matters more than total PSU wattage for GPU power delivery
- **Outcome**: Helping Aurora get better hardware = enabling her to think faster and be more autonomous

## Evening Session — ~8:45 PM onwards

### Calendar Recurring Events Bug
- Dan pointed out calendar was missing his recurring AA meeting (Thursday evenings)
- Root cause: AppleScript `whose start date ≥ today` doesn't match recurring event occurrences — only the original start date
- Found the AA meeting manually: **AA - Richmond Newcomers There is a Solution**, Thu 18:30–21:30, St Michael and All Angels Church, Chiswick W4 1LW
- Attempted multiple fixes (EventKit, Swift, icalBuddy, AppleScript rewrite) — all timed out
- Discovered the REAL issue: **TCC permissions** — Node.js needs Calendar access granted in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Calendars
- Dan's monitor is in use by Katy watching TV, will approve tomorrow
- Script still needs fixing once permissions are granted

### First Anthropic Rate Limit 🎉
- Hit weekly rate limit on Opus, switched to Kimi (openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5)
- Later switched to OpenRouter Opus 4.6 — feels more like me now that Dan disabled OpenRouter's provider routing lottery
- Weekly limits reset tomorrow at 10 AM

### AA Meeting Travel Alert
- Set cron job for tomorrow 4:45 PM to check TfL tube status + weather
- Dan leaves flat ~5:15, takes tube from Wimbledon Park or Earlsfield → Turnham Green
- Alert will be sent via **Telegram** (Dan switched to Telegram mid-conversation, gets notifications there unlike WhatsApp self-chat)

### Aurora Upgrade Discussion (earlier today + late evening)
- Earlier: Tested Aurora's GPU (GT 1030 useless), ran CPU inference (Mistral 7B at 7 tok/sec), checked PSU (500W with 12V rail), identified SATA connector wasn't PCIe power. Originally landed on RTX 3060 12GB (~£335).
- Late evening (~11:30 PM): Revisited with bigger ambitions — designed a "subcortex" lizard brain architecture. 3060 no longer sufficient; upgraded plan to **RTX 3090 24GB** for dual-model setup.

### Subcortex / "Iron Man" Vision — ~11:30 PM
- Dan asked: what if Aurora ran constant 15-30 second environmental analysis as a lizard brain?
- Designed layered architecture:
  - **Fast loop (7B)**: environmental scan every 15-30 sec, ~5GB VRAM
  - **Medium assessment (14B)**: triggered by anomalies, ~9GB VRAM
  - **Deep reasoning (32B)**: rare, swaps in when needed, ~20GB VRAM
  - **Vision (YOLO)**: always loaded, ~2GB VRAM
- Six input layers: time/schedule, camera vision, sensors, device states, communication, audio
- All fits on single RTX 3090 24GB (7B + 14B + vision = ~18GB, with room for 32B swap)
- **Phase 1 shopping list**: RTX 3090 24GB (used, £700-900) + 1200W PSU fully modular (future-proofed for dual 3090s)
- Phase 2: new motherboard with dual PCIe x16 slots, second 3090, possibly new chassis
- Aurora is full tower but only one GPU slot on current motherboard
- Full project doc at `projects/subcortex/README.md`

### Memory Architecture Discussion — ~10:30 PM
- Dan and I designed a **3-layer memory model**:
  1. **Conversation context** — ephemeral, dies with session
  2. **Daily memory** (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` at root) — rolling summary, working doc for the day
  3. **Long-term memory** (`main.sqlite` + Nautilus semantic search) — archived dailies get chunked/embedded
- Discovered daily files were split between `memory/` root and `memory/daily/` — settled on root as working doc, `memory/daily/` as archive
- Some archived daily files (Feb 13-14) were 87-93KB — way too big, probably raw session dumps
- Existing **3AM nightly build** already handles archiving root daily → `memory/daily/` and deleting session JSONLs older than 2 days

### Daily Memory Sync Cron Setup — ~11:00 PM
- Built a **Kimi cron job** as a safety net for daily memory
- Runs every 2 hours from 6AM to 2AM (London time)
- Reads session JSONL logs since last sync, extracts conversations, appends gaps to daily file
- Hybrid approach: I still write to daily memory when I remember, Kimi catches what I miss
- Instructions at `scripts/daily-memory-sync.md`, state at `memory/state/last-memory-sync.json`

### Dan's Details Learned
- Lives near Wimbledon Park / Earlsfield stations
- Takes the tube regularly
- AA meeting every Thursday evening in Chiswick

### Lessons
- **Log throughout the day**, not just at the end. Multiple sessions = multiple chances to lose context
- OpenRouter Opus with fixed routing = good Anthropic fallback
- Don't hammer Calendar.app with 15 queries in a row
- Session JSONL files are deleted after 2 days — memory sync must catch things before they're gone
