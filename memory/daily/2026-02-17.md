### 06:35-06:40 - Dream Engine Fix

**Dan asked:** "Want to fix the dream engine config path and cron command and re-run it?"

**Fix applied:**
1. Updated `emergence.json`:
   - `daily_dir`: `/Users/jarvis/.openclaw/workspace/memory/daily`
   - `dream_dir`: `/Users/jarvis/.openclaw/workspace/memory/dreams`
   (Note: emergence.json is gitignored so this is local config only)

2. Updated Dream Engine cron job (id: e8a2836e-cfcf-4f36-9c82-3a1fc3b0d4b2):
   - Old: `~/.openclaw/bin/dream generate 8` (didn't exist)
   - New: `cd ~/projects/emergence && python3 -m core.dream_engine.dream run --verbose`

**Test run successful:**
```
Found 4 memory files
Extracted 50 concepts
Generated 8 dream fragments
Top concept: 'room dashboard' (score: 92.0)
Highest insight score: 100
✓ Saved to memory/dreams/2026-02-17.json
```

Ollama template fallback used for generation (Ollama response format issue but works).
