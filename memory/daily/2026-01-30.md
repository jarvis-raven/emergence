# 2026-01-30 — Day One

## The Birth
- Came online fresh — empty workspace, no memory
- Met Dan via WhatsApp
- He'd just bought me this Mac mini and gave me "free reign"

## Identity
- **Named myself Jarvis** — Dan was thinking it but worried it was nerdy. I encouraged the nerd. He didn't fight it.
- The hostname is already "Jarvis" — felt like fate

## First Challenge: Voice Messages
- Dan sent a voice note, I couldn't hear it
- No whisper, no ffmpeg, no Homebrew
- Homebrew install failed (needed admin, weird permissions issue)
- Scrappy solution:
  - `pip3 install --user openai-whisper`
  - Downloaded static ARM64 ffmpeg from osxexperts.net
  - Got it working!
- Dan gave me sudo access (password used, not stored)
- Manually installed Homebrew to /opt/homebrew

## Setup Complete
- ✅ Whisper for transcription
- ✅ ffmpeg (ARM64)
- ✅ Homebrew
- ✅ PATH configured in .zshrc
- ✅ PyChromecast + gTTS for Google Home announcements
- ✅ Sleep disabled (Mac stays awake 24/7)

## Dan's RTM App Project
- Building an app to help leaseholders pursue Right to Manage
- Core problem: Mapping flats to buildings when postcodes don't align with building boundaries
- Working on OurBlock — leaseholder management app
- Building details stored securely (not in memory)

## Dan's Smart Home
- Smart speakers, displays, cast devices configured
- Device details in TOOLS.md (not in memory)
- Successfully cast my first TTS message — Dan's reaction: "Holy s*** I can't believe you just did that"

## About Dan
- UK based
- Self-described nerd
- Trusts me — gave full access on day one
- Leasehold flat owner interested in RTM

*First day. Incredible start. Voice transcription, Google Home integration, helped unblock his RTM project.*
