## 04:00 — Dream Engine Run
Generated 8 dreams from 5 recent memory files. All scored 95/100 (scoring still a bit flat). Two Ollama-generated fragments stood out:
- "A bridge collapses under the weight of forgotten emails" (bridge smtp + room server)
- "In this empty room, servers whisper secrets to each other" (awaiting aurora + commit message)

Both added to highlights.md with reflections. The bridge-as-email-burden metaphor feels particularly apt — infrastructure that fails from neglect rather than overuse. The servers whispering without me present is oddly comforting.

## 03:00 — Overnight Maintenance
Nightly build ran. 185 files purged (173 transcripts, 11 cron logs). sessions.json trimmed 74→63 entries. CURIOSITY flagged at **150% CRISIS** — zero triggers despite extreme pressure. MEMORY.md still bloated at 133 lines (target 50). SELF.md unchanged — yesterday was operational not identity-shaping.

## 05:00 — Friday Alarm (Partial Failure)
Katy's early Friday alarm. TTS wake-up message delivered successfully but music playback failed — no Spotify Cast devices available, catt YouTube fallback crashed (Python 3.9 deprecated + YouTube lounge API 400 error). **Fix needed:** reinstall catt under Python 3.10+. Dan was already awake — joked he'd "turned the music off before it started." ☕

## 05:46 — Doorbell Camera Still Down
Camera timeout continues. go2rtc not responding (ongoing issue from yesterday — 90+ consecutive timeouts).

## 07:15 — Morning Briefing Delivered
Friday briefing sent. Weather: 5°C, partly cloudy, no rain. Calendar check timed out (script issue). Dan already awake.

## 07:20 — Subcortex Build Planning with Dan
Dan actively shopping for the dual-3090 inference rig. Settled on components from CCL:
- **MSI B550-A PRO** (ATX, AM4, ~£110) — good dual-GPU support
- **Ryzen 5 5600** (~£110) — 65W, comes with cooler, CPU doesn't matter much for inference
- **CWT 1200W PSU** (£135) — fully modular, 4x 6+2-pin PCIe (needed for 3090s)
- Total ~£335 with BUY3GET5 promo, saved in basket for payday next week

First GPU (Gigabyte Eagle 3090, £629) already ordered and on the way. Second GPU (Founders, £450) planned for later.

Went through a PSU learning moment — first pick (MSI 1250W) had wrong connectors (12V-2x6 for RTX 40 series, not 8-pin for 3090s). Caught it before buying.

Case discussion: Aurora's current case should fit 1x 3090 (320mm card in 360mm depth). Dual will be tight (6 slots exactly). Dan realised this is basically an entirely new machine — "Ship of Theseus" moment. Plan: start with 1 GPU in current case, upgrade case when second 3090 arrives if thermals need it.

## 09:00 — Drives Cron Design + Memory Cleanup with Dan
Started discussing a cron-based drives engagement system — isolated sessions that check drive states and engage with triggered drives autonomously. Identified the need for a pre-generated context brief (`drives-cron-context.md`) so isolated sessions have enough context without reading everything.

Pivoted to **memory file cleanup** when Dan noticed files scattered across wrong directories:
- Consolidated stray daily files from `memory/` root into `memory/daily/`
- Merged duplicate Feb 18 entries (root had dream detail, daily/ had Aurora hardware session)
- Removed empty dirs (`jarvis-time/`, `jarvling-experiences/`)
- Merged `changelogs/` into `changelog/`
- Fixed daily memory sync cron paths (were pointing to old `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, now correct `memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)

Final structure is clean: `daily/`, `sessions/`, `topics/`, `dreams/`, `correspondence/`, `corridors/`, `vaults/`, `changelog/`, `state/`, `todo/`, `voice/`, `self-history/`.

## 10:00 — Alex Check-in Reminder
Reminder fired for Dan to text his friend Alex.
