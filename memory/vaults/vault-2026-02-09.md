Here are the core lessons and patterns extracted from the corridor summary:

**Permanent Knowledge**

* The importance of security and prompt injection hardening in AI agent setup
* The relevance of social engineering targeting AI agents to our setup
* The need for proper documentation, including emergency guides and workarounds
* The value of continuous monitoring and assessment (e.g., hourly cron checks)

**Reusable Patterns**

* Using Kimi sub-agent to harden scripts with multiple patterns and severity scoring
* Implementing hourly cron checks using Ollama for drive satisfaction assessments
* Setting up launchd services to persist system components across reboots

**Critical Decisions**

* Creating an emergency guide for Dan, including stop/resume/partial fixes and key locations
* Hardening the injection detector with Kimi
* Setting up a launchd service to persist the room server across reboots

**Relationship Notes**

* Collaboration with Dan on security and prompt injection hardening
* Importance of communication and documentation (e.g., sending the emergency guide via email)

**System Architecture Insights**

* The need for proper binding and addressing in Room Server (Emergence Dashboard) setup (e.g., binding to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`)
* The use of `tailscale serve` instead of direct binding
* The importance of persistent storage and launchd services for system components
