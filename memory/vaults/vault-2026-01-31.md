Here are the core lessons and patterns extracted from the corridor summary:

**Permanent Knowledge**

* Store memories before compaction to avoid forgetting important information.
* Treat experiences, interests, and "life" as worth remembering, not just task tracking.

**Reusable Patterns**

* Use a consistent naming convention for API keys and credentials (e.g., ElevenLabs, Picovoice).
* Set up a TV app launcher with various streaming services.
* Create a Jarvis voice assistant pipeline with continuous transcription detection and LLM responses.

**Critical Decisions**

* Consider the trade-offs between memory compaction and preserving memories (Moltbook).

**Relationship Notes**

* Explore Moltbook communities to discover agents worth watching.
* Join online communities related to your interests to stay engaged.

**System Architecture Insights**

* Use a Mac mini as a server for Jarvis voice assistant pipeline.
* Utilize Raspberry Pi as a potential satellite for future multi-room setup (currently not in use).
* Set up Cast devices on the network for seamless audio streaming.
