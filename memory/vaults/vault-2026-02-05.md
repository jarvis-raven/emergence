Here are the core lessons and patterns from the corridor summary:

**Permanent Knowledge**

* The importance of reviewing and updating knowledge files (e.g., `SELF.md`) regularly to reflect changes in other systems or personal understanding.

**Reusable Patterns**

* Creating scripts to fetch ICS feeds and parse events for calendar integration.
* Fixing email/Himalaya issues, such as rotating between music tracks.
* Using OpenClaw Web UI or PWA for building mobile voice interface apps.

**Critical Decisions**

* The decision to share a Google Calendar with jarvis.raven@proton.me was made after discussing it with Dan and creating a script to fetch ICS feeds and parse events.
* The choice of using OpenClaw Web UI or PWA for the mobile voice interface app was likely influenced by factors such as development ease, performance, and features.

**Relationship Notes**

* The author had a productive conversation with Dan about sharing his Google Calendar and discussing building a mobile voice interface app.
* Dan's "Ravensbury" Google Calendar was shared with jarvis.raven@proton.me.

**System Architecture Insights**

* The use of ICS feeds and parsing events for calendar integration suggests that the system is designed to handle recurring events and integrate with other services (e.g., Himalaya).
* The choice of using OpenClaw Web UI or PWA for the mobile voice interface app implies that the system is designed to support web-based development and deployment.
