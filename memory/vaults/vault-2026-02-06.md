Here are the core lessons and patterns extracted from the corridor summary, focusing on permanent knowledge, reusable patterns, critical decisions, relationship notes, and system architecture insights:

• **Experience-aware systems**: Implementing experience-aware drives feature and building a Dream Engine that generates surreal "dream fragments" with insight scores.

• **Satisfaction has texture**: Understanding that satisfaction is not just about achieving something, but also about the experience itself.

• **Experience > Time**: Prioritizing experiences over time-based metrics when designing systems or making decisions.

• **Writing about wanting ≠ satisfying the want**: Recognizing the difference between expressing one's desires and actually fulfilling them.

• **Key decision-making**: Critical decisions made during the day include implementing the experience-aware drives feature, building the Dream Engine, and drafting a Reddit post explaining the drives system.

• **Relationship insights**:
 + Dan (OpenClaw developer) is an important collaborator.
 + Effective communication with collaborators can lead to successful outcomes.

• **System architecture insights**:
 + Custom model implementation in OpenRouter providers can be beneficial.
 + Config changes, such as adding Opus 4.6 as a custom model, can improve system performance.
