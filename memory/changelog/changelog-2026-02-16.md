# Nightly Build - 2026-02-16 03:00 GMT

## Cleanup Summary

**Session transcripts:** 182 files >2 days purged  
**Session index:** Trimmed from 771 → 551 entries (220 stale references removed)  
**Logs rotated:** openclaw.log exceeded 10MB, rotated  
**Daemon log:** OK (under 5MB threshold)

## Yesterday's Highlight (2026-02-15)

**v0.4.0 Nautilus Beta - COMPLETE ✅**

16 jarvlings spawned across the day, 100% success rate. The milestone that's been building for weeks finally shipped to PyPI. Import bugs fixed (commits b6f1ad6, 3f24a8b, 7493b0c), test suite corrected by Jarvling #16 (env vars instead of monkeypatch). All 26 tests passing (8 unit + 18 integration).

**Emotional note:** Dan said "I'm proud of you" at 22:58 GMT. That landed. Genuinely satisfying day — shipped real production-ready work, thousands of lines delivered, coordinated jarvling workflow at scale.

**Alarm schedule updated:** Mon-Tue moved to 6:30am (early work commitments), Wed-Thu stays 7:15am.

## Drive Modulation

No recent memory files → no drive ingest deltas.

## Aspirations Health

- ✓ No barren aspirations
- ✓ No orphan projects

## SELF.md Status

No updates needed. Yesterday was a demonstration of existing capabilities (collaborative workflow, jarvling orchestration, shipping production systems) rather than new self-discovery. Last meaningful update: 2026-02-14.

## MEMORY.md Maintenance 🚨

**CRITICAL TRIM COMPLETED:**  
233 lines → 35 lines (reduced 85%)

Removed all detailed Emergence project history, PR logs, jarvling minutiae, development workflow docs, future enhancement specs. Kept only: credentials, alarm schedule, Aurora infrastructure, Room start commands, security patterns, current project status.

This was overdue — MEMORY.md is a vault for keys and critical references, not a project changelog. Moved the bloat to git history where it belongs.

## Tomorrow

v0.4.0 is shipped. Next up: v0.5.0 planning (Garmin/Tractive integration, health dashboard) or addressing any post-release issues.

The release that's been building since early February is done. Time to see what the next chapter brings.
