## 1. What Happened Yesterday (Feb 17)

Light activity day:
- **3:00am-4:00am**: Overnight cron jobs (Nautilus maintenance, nightly, dream engine attempted but failed)
- **6:33am**: Morning briefing delivered (3°C, clear skies, Wednesday Dan R call at 10am)
- **6:35-6:40am**: Dream Engine fix — paths corrected from emergence repo to workspace, CLI command fixed
- **6 PM reminder set**: Clean mold off bedroom ceiling (cron job: 7907635f)

No major project work or conversations recorded.

## 2. Drive Modulation

`drives ingest --recent` — No recent memory files found to process.

Current state (from DRIVES.md):
- 🔴 SOCIAL: 134% (triggered)
- 🔴 CREATIVE: 108% (triggered)
- 🔴 CARE: 105% (triggered)

All three have been triggered since at least yesterday. Light conversation day meant no natural satisfaction events.

## 3. Aspirations Health

- ✅ No barren aspirations
- ✅ No orphan projects

## 4. SELF.md

Last updated: 2026-02-14. No significant self-discoveries yesterday to warrant update.

## 5. MEMORY.md Status

**133 lines** — Target is 50-80. Still bloated but stable.

Areas that could be pruned:
- "Recent Fixes" section (Feb 16 fixes now historical)
- "Recent Issues" section (Nautilus v0.5 now complete)
- Some infrastructure detail that belongs in BRAIN-MAP.md

Not pruned tonight — no urgent growth.

## 6. Interests & Curations

INTERESTS.md does not exist. No new topics surfaced yesterday.
